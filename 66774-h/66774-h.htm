<br /><span class="cheaderfont">WHEN POVERTY ENTERS THE DOOR.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>To love and hate in the same breath, it is as cruel
as a tragedy.</p>

<p>Leon and Verna Dalrymple knew all that subtle pain
as they faced each other in the cold, gray light of
that autumn day whereon they were parting forever.</p>

<p>It was not simply a lovers’ quarrel, either.</p>

<p>The pity of it was that they were husband and wife,
both very young, both very fond, but driven apart by
unreasoning pride and passion.</p>

<p>The husband was twenty-one years old, the bride
but seventeen&mdash;a case of “marry in haste, repent at
leisure.”</p>

<p>Six months ago the bride, sole daughter of a wealthy
family, had eloped from boarding school with a poor
young man, a teacher of music.</p>

<p>For her fault the daughter had been cast off by her
parents, and the young man dismissed from the school
where he taught. Unable to secure another position,
misfortune had steadily tracked his footsteps until
he could scarcely afford bread for himself and the fair,
dainty bride.</p>

<p>Having rushed into marriage without thought for
the future, misfortune soured their naturally hasty
tempers, and when the fierce wolf of poverty came in
at the door love flew out of the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[6]</span></p>

<p>They could scarcely have told how it all began, but
at last they were quarreling most bitterly. There were
mutual recriminations and fault-findings, that increased
in virulence until one day, goaded by Verna’s
reproaches, Leon cried out in hot resentment:</p>

<p>“I regret that I ever saw you!”</p>

<p>“I hate you!” she replied, with a scornful flash of
her great, somber, dark eyes, and whether the words
were true or not, she never took them back&mdash;neither
one ever professed sorrow for angry words or begged
forgiveness. The husband, hurt by her sneers, pained
by her reproaches, and inwardly wounded by his inability
to provide for her better, took refuge in sullen
silence that she resented by downright sulking. She
was furious at his unkindness, disgusted with her poverty,
and unconsciously ill of a trouble she did not suspect,
so the breach widened between their hearts until
one day she said with rigid white lips and somber,
angry eyes:</p>

<p>“I am tired of starving and freezing here where I
am not wanted! I shall go home and beg papa to
forgive my folly and get me a divorce from you.”</p>

<p>The awful words were spoken and they fell on his
heart like hailstones, but though he grew pale as death
and his whole frame trembled, he feigned the cruelest
indifference, saying bitterly:</p>

<p>“You could not please me better!”</p>

<p>So the die was cast.</p>

<p>Perhaps she had wished to test his love, perhaps
she hoped that the fear of losing her might beat down
the armor of his stubborn pride and make him sue for
a reconciliation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[7]</span></p>

<p>Whatever she might have secretly desired, his answer
was a deathblow to her hopes.</p>

<p>At his words a strange look flashed into her large,
dark eyes, and for a moment her red mouth quivered
like a child’s at an unexpected blow. But she swallowed
a choking sob, and the next moment her young
face grew rigid as a mask.</p>

<p>Rising slowly from her seat, she put on her hat,
caught up a small hand satchel from the floor, and
passed silently from the poor apartment.</p>

<p>If only she had turned her fair, haughty head for
one backward glance&mdash;if only&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>For his passionate heart had almost leaped from
his breast in the terror of his loss.</p>

<p>Anger, pride, and pique were forgotten alike in the
supreme anguish of that moment’s despair.</p>

<p>As she turned away he stretched his arms out yearningly,
whispering with stiff, white lips that could
scarcely frame the words:</p>

<p>“Darling, come back!”</p>

<p>Had she only looked back, her heart would have
melted with tenderness at sight of his grief. She
would have fallen, sobbing, on his breast.</p>

<p>But she never turned her proud, dark head; she did
not catch the yearning whisper, and his arms dropped
heavily to his sides again, while the echo of her retreating
footsteps fell like a death knell on his heart.</p>

<p>Angry and estranged, they had parted to go their
separate ways forever, and the stream of destiny rolled
in widely between their sundered lives, thus wrenched
violently heart from heart.</p>

<p>To be born to the heritage of such beauty, pride,<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
and passion, is not altogether goodly&mdash;yet, it is the
daughter of this strangely parted pair whom I have
chosen for my heroine, for in four months after
Verna Dalrymple left her husband she became the
mother of a lovely daughter&mdash;a girl that in its dainty
beauty possessed the blond fairness of the father, the
dark, dreamy eyes and proud, beautiful mouth of the
brunet mother.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">SIXTEEN YEARS LATER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Sister Jessie, I am so hungry. Please give me some
bread!” sobbed the pleading voice of a little child,
clinging to the skirts of the young house mother, a
dark-eyed girl of sixteen.</p>

<p>“I’se hungry, too. I want my bekfus!” sobbed a
still younger child, petulantly, and for answer Jessie
stooped down and gathered both the little boys into her
yearning arms, crying tremulously:</p>

<p>“Wait a little while, my darlings, and sister Jessie
will go and try to get you some bread!”</p>

<p>Oh! what a tale of wretchedness was told by the
bare, fireless room and the pinched faces and hollow
eyes of the three children, the girl of sixteen, the boys
of six and four, respectively. It was midday, but
they had not tasted food for twenty-four hours, and
the cupboard was empty of the smallest crust. It was
a chilly November day, but the small stove was fireless,
though their thin, ragged garments were insufficient
to keep out the biting cold.</p>

<p>Jessie kissed the wan, tear-wet faces of her hungry
little brothers, then stood up again and looked
round the room to see if there was anything left
worthy the attention of the old pawnbroker on the
corner.</p>

<p>A choking sob escaped the girl’s lips:</p>

<p>“Alas, there is nothing but trash! The little purse
is empty, and the rent unpaid for two months. What
shall we do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[10]</span></p>

<p>A loud rap on the door gave her a violent start,
and she sprang to open it, exclaiming piteously:</p>

<p>“They have come again for the rent!”</p>

<p>She was confronted by a medium-sized young man,
good-looking in a coarse style with red cheeks, keen,
black eyes, and close-cropped, black hair, dressed flashily,
with a long, gold watch chain dangling across his
breast.</p>

<p>Staring curiously into the room and at the girl, he
demanded:</p>

<p>“Is John Lyndon at home?”</p>

<p>“He is not.”</p>

<p>“Where is his wife, then, hey?”</p>

<p>A sob came from all three of the children, but no
reply until a little, motherly looking woman suddenly
pushed past the young man into the room, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Arrah, now, how dare ye break the hearts av thim
by yer impidence, axin for their mither, and herself
dead of a faver six months ago!”</p>

<p>“Ah, and the father?”</p>

<p>“Poor sowl, they took him to the hospital, a month
ago, hurt by an accident, and he died there but yesterday.
I just came in to take the childer to git the last
look at his dead face before they bury him at the city’s
expinse.”</p>

<p>“Ah, very sorry, I’m sure, but, of course, now the
rent will never be paid, and I was sent here to bring
a dispossess warrant, so I may as well read it for the
benefit of the children.”</p>

<p>And he coolly proceeded to do so, apparently unmoved
by the sad story of death and disaster he had
just heard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[11]</span></p>

<p>Then he beckoned to two rough-looking men who
had been standing in the hallway. They came up at
once, and at a motion of the hand from the dispossess
officer, they began at once to move the few
shabby household effects into the street.</p>

<p>Painful sobs burst from the hapless orphans, but
the little Irishwoman, with the calmness of one long
familiar with the stern face of poverty, said to them
gently:</p>

<p>“You see, dears, ye are turned into the street. Have
yees any friends to take yees in?”</p>

<p>Jessie answered forlornly:</p>

<p>“We have an aunt, a dressmaker, in a distant part
of the city. She was papa’s sister, but he would never
let her know that we were so poor after he lost his
steady job, saying she had troubles enough of her
own.”</p>

<p>“Av coorse she will help yees, when she knows about
your troubles, poor things, so now come to my room
and have a little snack before we start to the hospital,”
said Mrs. Ryan tenderly, marshaling the orphans past
the dispossess agent, who remarked insinuatingly:</p>

<p>“The oldest girl’s big enough to go out and earn
her own living, and if her aunt won’t take her to keep,
I know of a situation she can get as parlormaid with
a very nice lady.”</p>

<p>“Thank you kindly, but I hope she won’t need it,”
returned Mrs. Ryan curtly, as she led the little flock
to her own poor apartment where she fed them on the
best she could afford, weak tea, baker’s stale bread, and
a bit of cheese, but a feast to the famishing orphans
whose thanks brought tears to her kind eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[12]</span></p>

<p>Afterward she took them to look their last on the
face of their dead before he was consigned to his grave
among the city’s pauper dead, poor soul, the victim of
penury and misfortune. Then she led them weeping
away to their aunt, Mrs. Godfrey, who heard with
grief of her poor brother’s death and looked with pity
on his orphan children.</p>

<p>She said plaintively:</p>

<p>“I’m a lone widow with a sick daughter and no support
but my needle, but, of course, I cannot turn John’s
children out into the cold world. I’ll take Mark and
Willie and do the best I can by them, but as for Jessie,
she is old enough to go out and work for herself. Besides,
she has no claim on me, as she was not my
brother’s child!”</p>

<p>“Not papa’s child!” almost shrieked Jessie, in her
astonishment, and Mrs. Godfrey, looking ready to
faint under the burden of her new responsibilities, replied:</p>

<p>“No, you were only the niece of my brother’s wife,
though she brought you up as her own child, and loved
you just as well.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ryan questioned eagerly:</p>

<p>“Are Jessie’s own parents living?”</p>

<p>“The Lord only knows,” was the answer, and, seeing
the anxiety on their faces, Mrs. Godfrey continued:</p>

<p>“You see, it was this way: Jessie’s father and
mother were divorced when they hadn’t been married
more than seven months or so, and afterward their
child was born, and when it was a few years old the
father in a fit of rage stole Jessie away from her<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
mother and brought her to his sister to raise as her
own. He went away and for years sent money liberally
to keep and educate the child, but at last letters
and money both stopped suddenly, and ’twas supposed
he was dead. The Lyndons kept Jessie all the
same, and did the best they could, but misfortunes began
to come and death followed&mdash;so everything came
to this pass. I’ll say it for Jess, she’s a good child,
but I’m too poor to keep her, so she will have to look
for a situation.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of one already, so I will take her back
and try to get it for her. Bid your little brothers
good-by, dear,” said Mrs. Ryan gently, in her pity for
the forlorn girl, who now turned to Mrs. Godfrey, faltering:</p>

<p>“Maybe you can tell me where to find my mother?”</p>

<p>“I can’t, my dear, for now I remember I never heard
her name, nor your pa’s, neither. You always went by
the name of Lyndon, and was considered their child, so
you will have to go on calling yourself Lyndon till
you find out better. Maybe your ma wasn’t a good
woman, anyway, or she wouldn’t had to be divorced.”</p>

<p>Cruel was the parting between Jessie and the little
ones, but with kisses and tears, and promises to come
again, the desolate girl was hurried away to her fate&mdash;every
link broken between her and the past, her brain
on fire, her heart aching, her future a chaos that no
hope could pierce.</p>

<p>“If I could only find my mother!” she sighed to
Mrs. Ryan.</p>

<p>“Sure, darlint, don’t fix your heart on her, for she
must have been a bad woman indade, or your father<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
wouldn’t have stole ye away and put ye in his sister’s
care. Arrah, now, I’m thinking of what the dispossess
agent said about knowing of a good place for ye to
stay as parlormaid. And good luck to ye, darlint;
there he is in front of the tiniment now, having the
old sticks of your furniture moved, bad cess to his
eyes! But then ag’in, ’tain’t his fault. He was sint by
the landlord to do it, and can’t help himself, so why
should we be hard on him, thin! Och, if you plaze, sir,
we would like to have the address of the good lady as
you said would take Jessie for a parlormaid.”</p>

<p>The agent’s face beamed with surprise and delight,
and, hastily drawing a card from his pocket, he
presented it, saying:</p>

<p>“There’s the address, and just tell the lady I sent
you, and I know she will give Miss Lyndon the place,”
beaming on the girl in a way that made her shrink and
shudder.</p>

<p>“Why, ’tis the old fortune teller in the next street,”
said Mrs. Ryan, surveying the dingy card that read:</p>

<p>“Know your fate and fortune. Consult Madame
Barto, scientific palmist, No. 16A West Twenty-third
Street. Hours between ten and four daily. Fee one
dollar.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A YOUNG GIRL’S FIRST THOUGHT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Madame Barto’s ideas of a parlormaid seemed
rather confused, for her gloomy little brick house had
no occupants save herself and Jessie, and before business
hours in the morning she and Jessie did up all the
household work, after which they separated, madame
to sit in her dingy parlor and read detective stories in
the intervals of waiting for customers, and Jessie to
wait in a tiny anteroom off the hall to answer the
doorbell.</p>

<p>The first thing that morning madame had gone out
and bought her maid a neat, black gown finished with
black and white ribbons, at neck and waist, and a neat
little pair of buttoned boots that made quite an improvement
in her appearance.</p>

<p>“This comes in advance out of your first month’s
salary, and I think you will agree I am very generous
to trust you,” she said frankly.</p>

<p>“I am very grateful, madame,” faltered the girl
shyly, for she stood greatly in awe of the tall, dark,
homely fortune teller, with her stern face and grenadierlike
walk.</p>

<p>“See that you prove so,” the woman said dryly, adding,
as she seized the girl’s hand and turned the pink
palm to the light: “Let us see what fate has in store
for such a pretty girl.”</p>

<p>“Shall I ever be married?” queried Jessie timidly,
and Madame Barto laughed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[16]</span></p>

<p>“Ha, ha, the first thought of a young girl&mdash;‘shall
I ever be married?’ Yes, yes, pretty one. I can promise
you a husband for certain! Girls like you&mdash;so
lovely and naïve&mdash;are very sure to marry, for the men
will not give them any peace. But you’ll repent it
afterward if you’re like most women. I know, for
marriage is a lottery, and more blanks are drawn than
prizes.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry. I thought love must be so sweet,” said
the girl with a little, unconscious sigh.</p>

<p>“Poor thing!” answered the woman, with a half
sneer, her keen, deep-set eyes following the lines of
the delicate palm while she pursued:</p>

<p>“I see dark clouds lowering over your life&mdash;and the
line of life is strangely crossed. I foresee tragic elements
in your future. The chances of happiness are
against you, but you may possibly overcome these
adverse influences. Let us hope so. Otherwise&mdash;&mdash;”
she paused, looked keenly at the girl, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“You will not thank me if I tell you any more.
What is the use, anyway? You will find it out soon
enough yourself. These people who pay me a dollar
for reading the future, what fools they are! If they
wait they will know it for nothing!”</p>

<p>Jessie hung her golden head in cruel disappointment,
having hoped that a good fortune might have
been promised from the reading of her little hand,
while the madame continued briskly:</p>

<p>“Come, now, you will sit here in the anteroom with
this bit of sewing until the doorbell rings, then you
will answer it, usher the caller in here, and come to
me for instructions. Will you remember this?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[17]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, madame,” sitting down obediently with
the roll of ruffling madame had given her to hemstitch,
eager to be alone with her sad thoughts.</p>

<p>Sad they were, indeed, poor Jessie, thus wrenched
from all she had known and loved in the past, and
thrown alone on the world, to face the untried future.</p>

</div></div></div></div>

<p>At the clanging of the doorbell she started quickly
to her feet with a strange, inexplicable throb of the
heart.</p>

<p>She flew out into the hall and turned the doorknob
to admit the caller.</p>

<p>Had she guessed that it was the little god Cupid
knocking, would she have unbarred the door?</p>

<p>Alas! destiny is strong. We could not shirk it if we
would.</p>

<p>The fair little hand shot back the bolt and turned
the doorknob.</p>

<p>And as the lid of Pandora’s box was opened, letting
out evil on the world, so with the opening of the door
Jessie let in love and pain:</p>

<p class="center">Those kinsfolk twain.
</p>

<p>On the threshold confronting her stood a young
man of perhaps four and twenty, and if you had
searched New York over you could not have found a
more perfect specimen of manly grace, strength, and
beauty.</p>

<p>Tall, athletic, with fine, clear-cut features, eyes like
deep, blue pools under thick-fringed lashes, brown,<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
clustering locks of silken gloss and softness, he was a
man to look at twice with frank admiration, and when
you added to nature’s gifts the best efforts of the
tailor, a man to set any girl’s heart throbbing wildly in
her breast.</p>

<p>“I wish to see Madame Barto, please,” he said, in a
voice of such strong agitation that Jessie looked at
him in wonder at the deep pallor of his handsome
young face and the lines of pain between his knitted
brows.</p>

<p>“I will tell madame,” she said, leaving him in the
anteroom, walking impatiently up and down.</p>

<p>Madame was deeply interested in her detective story,
and she yawned impatiently, saying:</p>

<p>“Tell him I’m engaged with a caller, and will be at
leisure in about ten minutes.”</p>

<p>“But he is in a hurry, and in some great trouble,
madame. You could read it in his face and his voice,
so strained and tremulous, poor fellow!” cried Jessie
warmly.</p>

<p>Madame laughed heartlessly:</p>

<p>“Oh, I know the type! Jealous young fool, just
had a quarrel with his sweetheart and wants to find
out if she will ever make it up with him! Let him wait.
Suspense will cool his temper. Meantime, I must have
ten minutes to finish this thrilling chapter! Go!” turning
eagerly to her book again.</p>

<p>The girl hurried back to the caller, who was pacing
impatiently up and down the room just as she had
left him.</p>

<p>“Madame Barto will be at leisure in ten minutes,”
she said gently, sitting down to her work again, while<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
the young fellow went to the window and drummed a
restless tattoo on the pane.</p>

<p>Jessie’s fingers had grown suddenly tremulous, and
the color flushed up in her young face, for through her
drooping lids she felt him gazing at her with suddenly
aroused attention.</p>

<p>And one looking once at Jessie Lyndon could not
help looking twice.</p>

<p>Of that rarest, most exquisite type, a dark-eyed
blonde, she was possessed of most alluring beauty that
not even want and poverty had sufficed to dim.</p>

<p>A little above medium height, slight and graceful,
with perfect features, an oval face, a skin as delicate
as a rose leaf, pouting, crimson lips, large, dark, haunting
eyes, and a mass of curling golden hair, she would
enchant any lover of beauty.</p>

<p>The young man, after watching her in blended admiration
and curiosity several minutes, suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Excuse me, are you Madame Barto’s daughter?”</p>

<p>Jessie lifted those large, dark, haunting eyes to his
face in wonder, answering:</p>

<p>“No, I am an orphan girl&mdash;living with madame and
working for her because I have no home nor friends.”</p>

<p>The pathos of the low-spoken words went to his
heart, and his voice grew soft with sympathy as he
said:</p>

<p>“My name is Frank Laurier. May I know yours?”</p>

<p>“It is Jessie Lyndon,” she replied, dropping her
eyes with a deepening blush at his eager glance.</p>

<p>“A pretty name. I should like to know you better,<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
Miss Lyndon. Will you take a little drive with me
in the park some afternoon?”</p>

<p>She started in such surprise that the sewing fell
from her little, trembling hands.</p>

<p>“Sir, I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;” she faltered confusedly.</p>

<p>He smiled at her dismay, and added eagerly:</p>

<p>“No, no, I don’t mean to be impertinent. I would
like the pleasure of a drive with you, and would return
you safe to madame afterward. Please say you
will accept my invitation,” he pleaded, his dark-blue
eyes shining with a light that sent a sweet, warm thrill
through her heart like a burning arrow&mdash;the flame-tipped
arrow of love.</p>

<p>She grew dizzy with the thought of driving with
him in the park&mdash;she, little Jessie Lyndon, poor, obscure,
friendless, to be chosen by this splendid young
exquisite, it was too good to be true.</p>

<p>“Will you go&mdash;to please me!” pleaded the musical,
manly voice, and she murmured tremulously:</p>

<p>“I&mdash;would&mdash;go&mdash;if madame&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Leave that to me. I will coax her,” he said radiantly,
as a little tinkle of the bell summoned him to
the fortune teller.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE WINNING OF A HEART.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Jessie set some very bad stitches in madame’s ruffling
the next half hour, for her slender fingers trembled
with the quick beating of her heart.</p>

<p>She had had her shy dreams of a lover, like other
girls, and now they seemed about to become blissful
reality.</p>

<p>Could it be he had fallen in love with her? This
rich, handsome young man&mdash;in love with the face that
she could not help knowing was very fair. Madame
must be mistaken thinking that his strange agitation
came from a quarrel with his sweetheart. He could
not have had any sweetheart, surely.</p>

<p>Her dark eyes beamed with joy, her cheeks glowed
crimson as a sea shell, and her heart throbbed wildly
with suspense. Madame Barto came in presently with
the young man, and said blandly:</p>

<p>“I have consented to your taking an hour’s drive in
the park with this gentleman, my dear, if you wish.”</p>

<p>“Let it be this afternoon. I will call for you
promptly at four o’clock,” he added, smiling at her
as he bowed himself out.</p>

<p>Madame Barto laughed knowingly, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“You pretty child, you are fortunate to have Frank
Laurier pay you such attention. He is well-born, and
rolling in wealth. Your dark eyes have turned his
head! Hark, the bell again!” and she retreated quickly
to her parlor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[22]</span></p>

<p>Jessie hurried to the door, and again her unconscious
hand opened the door to destiny.</p>

<p>A beautiful brunette of about twenty, richly gowned,
and with an imperious air, entered the hall, and said
curtly:</p>

<p>“I wish to see Madame Barto quickly.”</p>

<p>Jessie carried the message, and said:</p>

<p>“This young lady looks as pale and agitated as the
young man who has just left.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s another love scrape, I suppose. That’s
what usually brings them here! Well, you may send
her in at once!”</p>

<p>The moment that the beautiful brunette found herself
alone with Madame Barto she exclaimed breathlessly:</p>

<p>“Just now as I was passing in my carriage I saw a
young man I know&mdash;Frank Laurier&mdash;leaving this
house. Did he come to have his fortune told, or&mdash;or&mdash;to
see that lovely girl that admitted me?”</p>

<p>Madame answered demurely:</p>

<p>“To have his fortune told, of course. In the lines
of his hand I found a broken engagement, and he
wished to know if it would ever be renewed.”</p>

<p>“And you told him&mdash;&mdash;” eagerly.</p>

<p>“I beg pardon. I cannot disclose the secrets of my
customers,” madame returned, rather stiffly, as she
bent over the jeweled hand her customer had just
ungloved.</p>

<p>A bursting sigh heaved the young girl’s breast, and
she cried plaintively:</p>

<p>“Quick! What do you see?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[23]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, how strange! I see in your hand, also, a
broken engagement!” she exclaimed, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes&mdash;now, tell me, will we ever make it up,
our foolish quarrel!” cried the girl wildly.</p>

<p>Madame answered deliberately:</p>

<p>“The fates are against it. I see here that your path
will be crossed by a charming rival, who will lure his
heart away!”</p>

<p>The girl snatched her hand away and arose, furious
with passion, crying:</p>

<p>“Woe be unto that girl! She had better never been
born than come between me and my lover!”</p>

<p>“There are other men to love you!” consoled madame.</p>

<p>“What do I care for them? I want only him! And
I have been so foolish, I have driven him from me!
But no one else shall have him! I swear it!” cried
the brunette, her dark eyes flashing wildly, as she paid
the fortune teller, adding, “Come, tell me all you told
Frank Laurier, and all this is yours!” and she held
out a roll of bank notes.</p>

<p>Madame was not proof against the golden bribe, so
she answered:</p>

<p>“I told him the engagement would most likely never
be renewed&mdash;that a lovely blonde was fated to come
between them and cause much unhappiness.”</p>

<p>“Let her beware!” hissed the beautiful girl, under
her breath, as madame took up her hand again, saying:</p>

<p>“You have much to console you for a single disappointment
in love. You are beautiful and rich, and
you can have great success as an actress if you wish
to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[24]</span></p>

<p>“That is an old story. I do not wish to hear any
more&mdash;not that I believe what you have told me! It is
all jargon&mdash;he shall make up with me!” muttered the
proud, beautiful creature, tearing her hand from
madame’s, and flinging out of the room in a rage.</p>

<p>As Jessie opened the door for her exit she gave
the girl one keen, disdainful glance, whispering to
herself like one distraught:</p>

<p>“A lovely blonde! But she shall rue the day she
comes between us!”</p>

<p>She swept out of the house like a beautiful fury, and
Jessie sighed.</p>

<p>“She must be very unhappy in spite of her silks
and jewels!”</p>

<p>Then she forgot the haughty beauty in tender
thoughts of the man who had preceded her&mdash;“my
lover” she already called him softly to herself.</p>

<p>It seemed long to Jessie till four o’clock sounded,
though she was kept busy with the customers coming
and going all day, eager to know their fate and fortune
from the palmist.</p>

<p>But at last business hours were over, and Jessie and
her employer lunched frugally, after which the madame
said kindly:</p>

<p>“Now you may get ready for your drive with Mr.
Laurier, for it is on the stroke of four o’clock.”</p>

<p>There was no getting ready for a girl who possessed
but one gown, except to bathe her face and<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
hands and rearrange her wealth of sunshiny tresses in
the loose plait in the back, then affected by girls of her
age. This done, Jessie placed on her charming head
the black sailor hat madame had bought her, while
she sighed to herself:</p>

<p>“I fear my dress is not fine enough for a drive
in the park with such a grand, rich gentleman as Mr.
Laurier. Perhaps his fashionable friends will laugh
at me. I wonder why he cares to take me with him
like this, when he could have his pick of grand, rich
girls like the one that came to have her fortune told
this morning!”</p>

<p>The bell clanged loudly, and she flew with a beating
heart to the door, her cheeks glowing, her eyes
shining with the tenderest love light.</p>

<p>She had not the slightest doubt but that it was Frank
Laurier waiting outside.</p>

<p>She opened the door quickly, with a smile of welcome
on her coral lips.</p>

<p>Oh, how quickly the glad smile faded when she
saw instead the young man who had recommended her
to this place but yesterday&mdash;the dispossess agent.</p>

<p>He was dressed very fine in a loud, flashy style, and
smiled patronizingly at lovely Jessie, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Ah! Miss Jessie, how sweet you look. That new
dress is very becoming. Now, don’t you feel grateful
to me for getting you this nice place with my aunt? I
didn’t tell you Madame Barto is my aunt, did I? My
name is Carey Doyle, and I came to take you for a
nice little walk, if you will go with me.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;thank you, but&mdash;I have an engagement,”<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
Jessie faltered, drawing back in secret disgust from
her bold admirer.</p>

<p>“Well, you may break that engagement, my pretty
little Jessie, for I’m bound to have you for my little
sweetheart, I swear, and you shall give me a kiss to
seal the bargain!” protested Carey Doyle, crowding
her to the wall and throwing his arms around her slender
waist despite her cries and struggles in his effort
to press a kiss on the pouting, scarlet lips.</p>

<p>But in the excitement of his entrance they had forgotten
to close the door, and Frank Laurier, bounding
up the steps, took in directly the situation.</p>

<p>The next moment he had wrenched the burly wretch
away from Jessie, and thrust him by force down the
steps, aiding his progress by a kick as he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Take that for insulting the young lady!”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE FIRST KISS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Pale and trembling from her fright, Jessie leaned
against the wall when Frank Laurier returned to her,
jaunty and debonair, saying lightly:</p>

<p>“I have pitched the bold fellow down the steps, and
he has gone off out of the way. Why, how pale and
ill you look! Were you so much frightened of a
kiss?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;from that wretch!” she faltered, and his
deep-blue eyes laughed at her quizzically, and with
something like daring in them as he led her out to
the pavement to an elegant little trap, and, taking up
the reins, drove off in great style for the park.</p>

<p>Jessie’s heart throbbed with pride and joy, but she
still trembled violently from the struggle with Doyle.</p>

<p>She half sobbed:</p>

<p>“Oh, I never can thank you enough for driving
him away! If he had kissed me&mdash;oh, I should have
died of disgust!”</p>

<p>“Died of a kiss, ha, ha!” laughed the young man
gayly, so amused at the idea that it took firm hold of
his memory, to be recalled at a fateful aftertime.</p>

<p>“Have you never been kissed by a young man, then,
little Jessie?” he added, still laughing.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no, never!” blushing deeply.</p>

<p>“Then he will be a lucky young fellow who gets the
first kiss from you! I wonder who he will be! Can
you guess?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[28]</span></p>

<p>The great, dark eyes stole a shy glance at him under
the drooping lashes, as she whispered demurely:</p>

<p>“Only the man I shall marry!”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed!”</p>

<p>Did he think she was chaffing him, or coquettishly
daring him, or what? It is certain he was in a reckless,
flippant mood, and that swift glance of hers
warmed his blood like wine. They were in the park
now, driving under the shadow of some autumn-colored
trees, and all in a flash his arm slipped round her
waist, the brown head bent over the golden one.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">Two faces bent&mdash;
</div><div class="indent0">Bent in a swift and daring dream,
</div><div class="indent0">An ecstasy of trembling bliss,
</div><div class="indent0">And sealed together in a kiss.
</div></div></div></div>

<p>She did not struggle, sweet Jessie, against this
bold caress, simply yielded to it with a delirious throb
of joy, letting his lips drain the sweetness of hers unhindered,
as a bee sips the sweets of the rose, her
thrilling form resting quiescent against the arm that
clasped her close to his heart. When he released her,
neither spoke a word, Jessie sat very still, her form
inclined slightly toward him, her eyes downcast and
shining, her cheeks warmly flushed, her moist lips
tremulous, her bosom heaving with emotion, a lovely
picture of girlish tenderness on which the young man’s
eyes rested with pleasure.</p>

<p>He touched up the sleek, black ponies with the whip,
and directly they were borne into the thick of the
crowd that made the beautiful drives a gay, changeful
panorama of fine horses, smart turnouts, and magnificently
dressed women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[29]</span></p>

<p>Frank Laurier blent readily with the animated
crowd, sitting erect with a very pale face, compressed
lips, and eyes that glittered with a blue fire as he swept
them eagerly and restlessly over the passing faces, returning
salutations every moment or so, and seemingly
almost forgetting the girl by his side in some secret,
overmastering excitement.</p>

<p>As for her, if she could have thought of anything
but that kiss and the bliss of his nearness, she would
have begun to feel out of place in her cheap, simple
dress there in the moving throng of richly garbed
women, whose glances rested in wonder on the fair
face and cheap attire of the girl by Laurier’s side.
She did not, indeed, guess how different she looked
from the others, or how very strange it was for a
man in his position to run the gantlet of all those
curious, surprised eyes&mdash;he, one of the fashionable
four hundred, with that little working girl by his side.</p>

<p>If the innocent child gave a thought to the incongruity,
she only felt it as a tribute of his regard for
her.</p>

<p>She felt an exquisite pleasure in thus being exhibited
at his side to the habitués of his particular world, and
did not realize the strangeness of his inattention to herself,
or the eagerness of his excited glance as it roved
from carriage to carriage filled with fair faces and
bright, sparkling eyes, as if in restless search for some
one.</p>

<p>At last!</p>

<p>Jessie, close to his side, felt the young man give a
quick start of surprise and emotion, at the same moment
lifting his hat with a low bow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[30]</span></p>

<p>She saw passing them on the drive a splendid, low
victoria, containing two handsome, elegantly dressed
ladies, one past the first blush of girlhood, the other&mdash;oh!&mdash;the
dark beauty of this morning who had
come to Madame Barto’s to know her fate and fortune!</p>

<p>Jessie’s dark, uplifted eyes met and held for a
moment the flashing orbs of the beautiful brunette, and
all in a moment she felt as if she were withering in
the heat of some desert simoom, so fierce and malevolent
was that look that seemed to scorch her very soul.</p>

<p>She thought with a thrill of nameless fear:</p>

<p>“The beautiful stranger hates me!&mdash;I wonder why!”</p>

<p>But the next moment the fear was blotted out in a
new terror.</p>

<p>No one could ever tell what frightened Frank Laurier’s
spirited ponies, but just as they passed the victoria
they bolted wildly and ran away in spite of his
close grip on the reins, creating a terrible panic and
confusion, and barely missing a collision with another
carriage.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">FATE’S DECREE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>If Jessie had turned her fair head to look back as
she drove off so triumphantly with her handsome escort,
she would have seen Carey Doyle scrambling up
from the gutter where he had landed after his animated
encounter with Laurier, and shaking his fist
after her malevolently, while curses low and deep
shrilled over his lips, and his eyes blazed with a baleful
light that boded no good to those who had aroused
his jealous anger.</p>

<p>Brushing the soil of the gutter from his flashy suit,
he shambled across the pavement and back into the
house from which he had been so vigorously ejected.</p>

<p>Madame Barto herself met him on the threshold,
and drew him in, exclaiming hoarsely:</p>

<p>“Why, Carey, what is the meaning of this? I was
just coming into the hall to see Jessie off on her drive,
when I beheld her struggling in your arms, and the
next moment Mr. Laurier grasped you and sent you
spinning down the steps like a top!”</p>

<p>“Laurier! Is that his name, curse him?” grumbled
Doyle, rubbing his knee which seemed to have been
crippled by the fall, and continuing excitedly, “It was
this way, Aunt Barto: I fell in love with pretty little
Jessie the minute I clapped my eyes on her yesterday,
the beggarly little minx, and when I did her the good
turn to send her to you, of course I meant to have my
innings for the good deed. This afternoon I spruced<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
up in my very best and came to take her for a walk,
but as soon as I came in and asked her, she tossed up
her yellow head like a princess and said she had another
engagement. My temper flared up and I said she
should go with me and give me a kiss into the bargain,
but when I grabbed her she fought like a little cat,
and then that dandy rushed in like a whirlwind, caught
me up with the strength of ten men and pitched me
down the steps, rolling me into the gutter and nearly
breaking every bone in my body, ugh!” with another
groan.</p>

<p>“But, Carey, I thought you were courting that little
Jewess, Yetta Stein.”</p>

<p>“So I am, and have bought the ring, but it’s all up
with that since I’ve seen Jessie. Besides, Yetta’s
family were bent on making me embrace the Jewish
religion before the knot was tied, so I can refuse to
do it and break off that way.”</p>

<p>“You mean to say you’ll throw over the match with
the rich pawnbroker’s daughter for the sake of this
beggar, Jessie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will. I wasn’t thinking at first of marriage,
only having some good times with her, but now that
dandified Samson has showed up I’ll take her from
him if I can, just to break his heart as he tried to
break my neck. Curse him!”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw, Carey, it’s nonsense of you to think of
competing with a rich young millionaire like Frank
Laurier. Why, he never saw her before to-day, and he
must have become quite fascinated with her at first
sight, for he invited her to drive with him in the park
this afternoon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[33]</span></p>

<p>Carey Doyle shook his fist and raved impatiently:</p>

<p>“Thunderation! I say he shall not! I’ll follow
them to the park, frighten his horses, and make them
run away and break both the upstarts’ necks.”</p>

<p>“What good would that do, you foolish fellow?
Better dismiss them both from your mind and stick
to Yetta.”</p>

<p>“I won’t, so there! I swear to have Jessie Lyndon,
by hook or crook!”</p>

<p>“You cannot succeed. I have read both their hands,
and if the science of palmistry is true, which I firmly
believe, those two, Laurier, the millionaire, and Jessie,
the little working girl, are meant for each other by
fate.”</p>

<p>“Bah, curse palmistry! Didn’t you read my hand
and tell me a pack of lies?”</p>

<p>“No, I told you that a prison yawned for you, and
that only a lawyer’s quibble would be able to save your
neck from the gallows. I begged you to restrain your
evil propensities and try to avert the disaster if you
could! And I read all this written in your hand as
plain as print,” returned the fortune teller solemnly,
with full faith in her art; but, with an oath of incredulous
scorn, her nephew limped heavily out of the house.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE BEAUTIFUL RIVALS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When the beautiful brunette in her drive through
the park met Jessie Lyndon riding by the side of
Frank Laurier, all the blood in her veins seemed momentarily
to turn to ice in the shock of surprise, and
then to burn like liquid fire under the impulse of jealous
rage.</p>

<p>If a look could have killed, the fierce gleam of her
eyes must have slain her fair rival instantly, as by a
lightning flash!</p>

<p>Then all at once something terrible happened.</p>

<p>Frank Laurier’s gayly prancing horses suddenly
snorted with fear and rage, and bounded forward so
swiftly that he lost his grip on the reins, having been
momentarily unstrung by a meeting he had anticipated
ever since entering the park.</p>

<p>A dreadful panic ensued on the crowded driveway.</p>

<p>The air was filled with shouts and cries that only
maddened the frantic steeds dashing madly forward
without control, for all Laurier’s efforts to regain his
reins were fruitless, and, leaning too far forward, he
was jerked violently to one side and thrown from the
vehicle out upon the ground, leaving Jessie alone, clinging
desperately to the seat, her lovely face convulsed
with terror, her dark eyes dilated with fear and dim
with raining tears, a picture of beauty and distress,
while her frightened shrieks rang wildly on the air.</p>

<p>Another harrowing moment, and the anguished<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
voice was hushed, the sweet eyes closed, the throbbing
heart stilled! In their mad rush trying to evade capture,
the horses collided with a tree, shattering the light
vehicle, and hurling the young girl out upon the grass.
All white and unconscious, she lay there, a thin stream
of blood trickling down her temple where a stone had
grazed it and staining the gold of her hair with crimson.</p>

<p>A sympathetic crowd soon gathered around, exclaiming
in wonder and pity at her girlish beauty and
her sorrowful plight.</p>

<p>But in a minute a light dogcart that had swiftly
followed the runaways was reined in upon the spot, and
a young man sprang quickly from it, advancing on the
scene, while he cried with an air of authority:</p>

<p>“Stand back, everybody, and give her air!”</p>

<p>“Who is she? Who is she?” rang on every side,
and the young man, who was no other than Carey
Doyle, answered impudently:</p>

<p>“She is my little sister Jessie, and I would like to
take her home, if you people will give me room to
pass!”</p>

<p>Before his impatient show of authority, every one
stupidly gave way, and, lifting her carefully in his
arms, Carey Doyle placed Jessie in the dogcart, while
he muttered exultantly to himself:</p>

<p>“Ah, my scornful little beauty, you are in my power
now, and I will pay you well for your fine airs as well
as for the kick that rich fool gave me!”</p>

<p>He was about to leap into the cart when an elegant
victoria drove up, in which sat two very handsome<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
women. One of them, the youngest, leaned forward
and called him to her side.</p>

<p>Flashing her great eyes imperiously at the impatient
young man, she whispered eagerly:</p>

<p>“What is she to you?”</p>

<p>He muttered curtly:</p>

<p>“My sweetheart!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” she murmured joyfully, and added softly:
“I saw you come up behind them and frighten his
horses with the lash. Why did you do it?”</p>

<p>His coarse face was scowling as he answered sullenly:</p>

<p>“She went with him against my will, and I was
furious enough to kill them both!”</p>

<p>“Do not be afraid of me&mdash;I will not betray you unless
you disobey my orders. Listen: He is my lover,
and she is trying to lure him from me. It is your
task to keep them apart, and if they ever meet again,
I will denounce you for this crime. You understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and will obey!” he returned, just as the other
lady leaned across the seat, saying anxiously:</p>

<p>“What does he say about the young girl? Is she
injured much?”</p>

<p>Carey Doyle answered quickly:</p>

<p>“Only a scratch on the temple and a fainting spell,
madame. I’ll take her home fast as I can, and she
will soon be all right,” and he leaped into the cart.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” she said kindly, and, as he drove away,
she said to her companion:</p>

<p>“What an exquisitely lovely face the poor girl has!
And what beautiful sunny hair, so fine and curly! I<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
wonder who she is, Cora, and where Frank happened
to make her acquaintance?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you all I know when we get home,” the
young lady answered, frowning darkly at the memory
of that morning’s rencontre at Madame Barto’s with
lovely Jessie.</p>

<p>She thought viciously:</p>

<p>“That old witch lied to me&mdash;she knew he was there
to see the girl, but she feared to own the truth to me.
But I shall have an ally now in the man who carried
her off this evening, and woe to him if he breaks
faith with me!”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“SHE SHALL BE MINE?”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>With an evil smile on his face, Carey Doyle whipped
up the horse and drove swiftly back to his aunt’s house,
his eyes gloating on the pale, unconscious beauty of
Jessie’s face as it lay across his knee where he had
carefully placed it.</p>

<p>The man’s heart was aroused as it had never been
before by this lovely girl, and he vowed to himself
that she should become his own.</p>

<p>In the gray dusk of the November day he carried
her into the house, to the dismay of Madame Barto,
who exclaimed:</p>

<p>“So you were as good as your word! You tried to
kill the poor child!”</p>

<p>Carey Doyle denied the impeachment with the greatest
sang-froid, protesting that on the contrary he had
saved the poor girl’s life in a runaway accident.</p>

<p>“And as soon as you bring her around I want to
have a serious talk with you,” he said, as she turned
him out of the little hall bedroom where Jessie lay on
her narrow cot.</p>

<p>He waited impatiently in the parlor about half an
hour before she reappeared, saying:</p>

<p>“She was hard to revive, and hardly knows what
has happened to her yet, so I just gave her a sedative
and left her to fall asleep while I come to hear
what you have to say, Carey.”</p>

<p>“Well, as I told you just now, Laurier’s horses<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
bolted in the park and ran away, pitching him out, and
leaving Jessie in. I happened to be looking on and
stopped the team and saved her life.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said the fortune teller approvingly, and he
continued:</p>

<p>“While I took Jessie into my dogcart to bring her
home, two swell Fifth Avenue ladies had Laurier put
into a carriage and taken home. Now, aunt, I want
you to help me to win Jessie Lyndon, and to give up
all such notions as Fate having cut her out for Mr.
Laurier. It isn’t likely that he means fair by Jessie,
anyway; rich young men don’t often marry poor girls,
you know; while I’ll make her my wife at any moment
you persuade her to have me.”</p>

<p>“How am I to manage it?”</p>

<p>“Tell her that Laurier was killed in the accident,
and keep her a prisoner in her room until she consents
to marry me.”</p>

<p>“A risky game&mdash;and what am I to gain by it, anyway?”
asked madame significantly.</p>

<p>Doyle laughed coarsely:</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve helped you often enough in risky games,
so it’s your turn now. You just help me in this, or
I’ll split on you. See? And you know what I can
say and do if I want to. But you do the right thing
and I will, too. Here’s some money, but mind you do
the right thing, or you’ll be sorry. I’ll go now and
call to-morrow evening to see how our plan works,”
he said, rising to go.</p>

<p>Alas, poor little Jessie, surrounded by cruel plotters
and a jealous foe, it might have been better if
she had died in the heavy sleep that lulled her senses<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
that dreary night rather than awaken to the sorrow of
the next day.</p>

<p>When she sighed and opened her heavy-lidded eyes
again, the fortune teller stood by the bed, looking
down at her with a penetrating gaze.</p>

<p>“Ah, what a long sleep you’ve had, child. Do you
feel better?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Better!” cried Jessie, then a wave of memory swept
over her, and she moaned, “Oh, how terrible it was!
How came I here? And he&mdash;oh, where is he?”</p>

<p>Madame took her hand and answered solemnly:</p>

<p>“You may well ask, where is he? Poor child, how
can I tell you the dreadful truth? But you will have
to bear it. He&mdash;poor Frank Laurier&mdash;was killed
stone-dead!”</p>

<p>A shriek rang through the room&mdash;long, loud, heart-rending!&mdash;then
Jessie lay like one dead before the
heartless woman.</p>

<p>Madame Barto would never forget that day.</p>

<p>Jessie Lyndon’s grief for Frank Laurier when she
recovered from her long swoon was indeed heart-rending.</p>

<p>In vain madame expostulated:</p>

<p>“Why should you take on so? You never saw him
till yesterday!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I cannot understand it, but I know that he was
as dear to me as if I had known him a year!”</p>

<p>“A young girl must not give her heart unsought.”</p>

<p>“Oh, madame, I did not. Oh, my heart!”</p>

<p>The girl flung herself back on the pillows in an
agony of grieving that strangled words on her lips, and
it was hours later when she asked plaintively:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[41]</span></p>

<p>“Where have they taken him?”</p>

<p>Madame answered soothingly:</p>

<p>“Two lady friends of his were in the park when he
was killed&mdash;Mrs. Dalrymple and Miss Ellyson of Fifth
Avenue&mdash;and they had him conveyed to their home.”</p>

<p>Jessie instantly remembered the ladies she had seen
in the victoria, especially the dark, brilliant beauty who
had frowned at her so blackly.</p>

<p>She gasped faintly:</p>

<p>“Oh, I must see him once more before he is hidden
from me forever in the cold, dark grave!”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” cried madame sternly, and though
the half-distraught girl knelt to her in an agony of entreaty,
she still refused her prayer. Indeed, she could
do no less, seeing what a falsehood she had told.</p>

<p>Then Jessie grew angry and desperate.</p>

<p>“You are wicked and heartless to tell me I cannot
see him once before he is buried! I defy you! I will
go!” she cried, with a passion of which madame had
not believed her capable.</p>

<p>The dark, dreamy eyes flashed defiance out of the
deadly, pale face, alarming Madame Barto so that she
snatched up Jessie’s clothing and bore them away in
triumph, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“There, now, I don’t think you will run off to Fifth
Avenue in your nightgown, miss!”</p>

<p>And, locking the door on the outside, she left the
poor girl to her fate, forgetting that in Jessie’s closet
there still remained hanging the cheap, threadbare garments
she had worn when she came.</p>

<p>But Jessie remembered, and she quickly put them
on again, the torn calico gown, the broken shoes, the<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
old sailor hat&mdash;then she drew aside the curtain and
looked out, starting to find that the gray November
day was near its close and the sky overcast with
threatening snow clouds.</p>

<p>How long it seemed since yesterday! He had been
twenty-four hours dead.</p>

<p>Dead! Oh, how impossible it seemed for such
youth and strength and beauty to be so quickly annihilated.
His kiss still burned like fire on her lips and
thrilled warmly through her veins.</p>

<p>“Oh, I must see him once again!” she sobbed, and
pushed up the sash and measured the distance to the
ground with frantic eyes.</p>

<p>It was only a story and a half, and a neglected
awning rope fortunately hung from her own window.
With a low cry of joy, Jessie caught it and knotted
it to the window shutter. When it grew a little darker
she climbed up into the window and swung herself out,
tremblingly, on the frail support.</p>

<p>Halfway down to the ground the rope broke with
her weight, and gave her a fall to the pavement, but
the distance was not great, and with a little, stifled
moan of pain, she dragged herself up from the ground
and hurried off through the darkness, sobbing:</p>

<p>“I know where Fifth Avenue is, and I will go there
if it kills me. But I hope that proud, beautiful lady
will not be there to wither me with her angry eyes!”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">AN HOUR TO BE REMEMBERED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The Fifth Avenue mansion where Mrs. Dalrymple
lived was little less than a palace as she was little less
than a princess, if royal beauty, royal wealth, and almost
royal state could count. Her parents were dead,
she was mistress of herself and many millions, and at
barely thirty-three, while looking scarcely twenty-five,
had scores of hearts at her feet from which to choose,
if that way lay her happiness.</p>

<p>Some said that she had been widowed young, others
that she was divorced, some that her heart was buried
in a grave, others that she was a man hater. No one
ever heard her own that either was true. She simply
smiled and went her way, heedless of praise or blame.</p>

<p>That autumn evening when she swept down the
grand staircase into the brilliantly lighted hall, her rich
violet velvet robe trailing behind her, her jewels flashing
like stars, she heard an altercation at the door.
Her pompous servant was saying harshly:</p>

<p>“You cannot come in here; no, indeed, there’s no
use begging me, I tell you. Go around to the servants’
entrance!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dalrymple stopped short, listening to the low,
pleading, girlish voice that half sobbed:</p>

<p>“I tell you I’m not a beggar! Oh, do let me in to
see Mr. Laurier just once more!”</p>

<p>The man was about to laugh rudely just as his mistress
came up behind him, exclaiming in her sweet,
frosty voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[44]</span></p>

<p>“What is the trouble here?”</p>

<p>The man stepped back in dismay at the question,
and a girlish form rushed past him and knelt at the
lady’s feet.</p>

<p>It was Jessie Lyndon in her tattered garments, on
which clung flecks of melting snow, her face drawn
and pallid with misery, the tears half frozen on her
cheeks, her form trembling with weariness, her beauty
half obscured by her miserable plight, as strange a contrast
to that palatial scene and the queenly woman before
her as the mind could well imagine.</p>

<p>She knelt before the startled lady with upraised,
pleading eyes and pathetic clasped hands, imploring:</p>

<p>“Oh, madam, forgive me this intrusion, but my
heart is breaking! Oh, will you let me see Mr. Laurier
once before he is lost to me forever!”</p>

<p>“Child, this is very strange!”</p>

<p>“Oh, madam, let me explain! I have a right to see
him. We were out driving. There was such a dreadful
accident! Oh, you can see for yourself how my
heart is breaking!” wailed the poor girl, losing all control
over her emotion, and sobbing outright.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dalrymple cried out in the greatest wonder:</p>

<p>“Why you are the little girl that was with Frank
in the runaway accident yesterday, are you not? How
very, very strange you look and act, poor child! You
should not come here to see Mr. Laurier, you know.
It is not proper to do so, and, besides&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Jessie interrupted wildly:</p>

<p>“Oh, madam, do not scold me, I pray you. I am
wretched enough already. Is there not a woman’s
heart beating under your silks and jewels the same as<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
under my rags? Then pity me, I implore you, and
grant the boon I crave! Let me see him but once.”</p>

<p>“All this is very strange to me, child, and for my
life I cannot understand why you should be so anxious
to see Frank Laurier, but I cannot resist your frenzied
appeals, they touch me too deeply. He is in there. Go
in and speak to him!” waving her jeweled hand toward
the closed portières of a room on the left of the magnificent
corridor.</p>

<p>With a strangled sob, Jessie sprang toward the curtains.
Impelled by sympathy she could not understand,
Mrs. Dalrymple followed her footsteps.</p>

<p>Frank Laurier was lying at ease on a sofa with one
foot on a cushion&mdash;having sustained a severe sprain
to one ankle that would keep him Mrs. Dalrymple’s
welcome guest for several days. Some strips of court
plaster on the side of his face slightly marred his
beauty to an ordinary observer, but not to Jessie Lyndon,
who, advancing at first with slow, awed footsteps,
suddenly stopped, stared, then flew across the room to
the sofa, murmuring in joyful incredulity:</p>

<p>“Alive! Alive!”</p>

<p>She sank on one knee, and pressed her lips tenderly
on one hand that was thrown carelessly above his
head.</p>

<p>“Why, that wicked woman told me you were dead!
And I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;” the sweet voice faltered.</p>

<p>A low, derisive laugh rang on the air, and, lifting
her eyes, Jessie saw that they were not alone.</p>

<p>It was Cora Ellyson who had laughed, as with flashing
eyes she pushed Jessie away from Frank’s side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[46]</span></p>

<p>“Go away, you bold girl, how dare you force your
way in here to annoy Mr. Laurier?” she cried angrily.</p>

<p>“Annoy him; I&mdash;it is not true! Do I annoy you?”
pleaded Jessie tremulously, turning to the young man
whose handsome face twitched with pain as he answered
impatiently:</p>

<p>“My dear Miss Lyndon, this is very strange on your
part! To come bursting into the room like this. What
is the matter?”</p>

<p>To the day of his death he would never forget what
happened in that room after his cold and haughty reception
of little Jessie.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE ENDING OF HER LOVE DREAM.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Laurier, startled, dismayed, and angered by Jessie’s
sensational entrance, had spoken to her more harshly
and hastily than if he had taken second thought.</p>

<p>The hateful, mocking laugh from Cora Ellyson accentuated
his words, and Mrs. Dalrymple, who had
paused just inside the door, gazed in wonder at the
strange scene.</p>

<p>Instantly Jessie sprang to her feet. She stood still
a moment, looking at him with wounded love, doubt,
fear, incredulity, all struggling together in her great,
soft, dark eyes like a dying fawn’s.</p>

<p>Again Cora Ellyson laughed, low and mockingly&mdash;a
hateful, significant laugh that made Frank Laurier
exclaim rebukingly:</p>

<p>“Hush, Cora, you are unjust!”</p>

<p>Then he looked at Jessie pityingly. He wished
that he were not lame that he might fly from the room
to avoid the plaintive reproaches of the one girl and
the jealous fury of the other. Mrs. Dalrymple, who
had drawn gradually nearer and nearer, was listening
with a face drawn with deep emotion, but again Cora
Ellyson’s scornful laugh rang through the room, and
before Jessie could speak again, she cried mockingly:</p>

<p>“Pshaw, Frank, why not tell her the plain truth as
you were telling me before she came in when we made
up our silly lovers’ quarrel? Listen, Miss Lyndon; it
was this way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[48]</span></p>

<p>“Hush, Cora, do not wound her so!” he entreated,
but she advanced and stood close by him, silencing him
by an imperious gesture, her rich silken robes rustling,
her jewels flashing, her proud, dark head lifted haughtily
as she surveyed her shrinking rival, poor Jessie, in
her worn, shabby garments and broken shoes.</p>

<p>“It was this way, Miss Lyndon: Frank Laurier and
I were plighted lovers until three days ago, when we
had a foolish little lovers’ quarrel and parted, vowing
never to meet again. But our wedding day was but a
few days off, and as soon as we separated both began
to repent, but were too proud to say so. Is not this
true, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;but do not wound the child’s heart by telling
her the rest,” he implored, almost inaudibly.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” she answered lightly, and added:
“This is the rest, Miss Jessie Lyndon. Frank saw you,
and, struck with your pretty face, decided to pique me
into a reconciliation by flirting with you. Hence the
drive in the park that resulted as he wished, in the making-up
of our little difference to-day, and I assure you
that but for your intrusion here this evening, he would
never have given you another thought!”</p>

<p>She ended with a little, tinkling laugh of triumphant
scorn that fell like hailstones on the heart she had
crushed.</p>

<p>The cruel truth was out, and when the echo of that
exultant laugh died away there was a silence like death
in the brilliant, sumptuous room.</p>

<p>Frank Laurier, with a low, inarticulate cry, tried
to rise from his recumbent position, scarcely knowing
what to do, but his sweetheart’s jeweled hand on his<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
shoulder firmly pressed him back, while they gazed in
rising awe at Jessie Lyndon.</p>

<p>She stood among them a breathing statue of shame-stricken
girlhood, the hot color glowing in her cheeks,
and mounting up to the roots of her bright hair, her
red lips parted and tremulous, the big tears hanging
like pearls on her lashes, her bosom rising and falling
with emotion beneath the shabby gown that could not
hide the budding grace of her perfect form.</p>

<p>This poor girl, so fair, so friendless, to whom no
one spoke one word of sympathy, so terribly alone
among them all, what would she do?</p>

<p>For several moments she did not speak a word&mdash;she
could not, for the terrible, choking sensation in
her throat, and the mad leaping of her burdened heart
in her breast&mdash;then, as the scarlet glow faded into
deadly pallor, she lifted her heavy eyes up to Cora
Ellyson’s face.</p>

<p>“I cannot bear it, God forgive me!” she cried, and
the little hand pressed to her lips a tiny vial, then flung
it down empty as she rushed from the room, eluding
the detaining hand Mrs. Dalrymple stretched forth.</p>

<p>“She has taken poison! Follow, and bring her
back!” shouted Frank Laurier rising in alarm, then
falling back with a groan on the sprained foot that
would not support his weight.</p>

<p>“Pshaw, she was only shamming!” his proud sweetheart
answered coolly, helping him back to his sofa,
and bending to press a kiss on his brow.</p>

<p>But he did not notice the fond caress. He groaned
in a sort of agony:</p>

<p>“My God, it is all my fault; I did not realize what<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
I was doing! If she dies, poor girl, it will lie at my
door, her cruel fate.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Frank, it was not your fault, her making
such a little fool of herself, trying to catch a rich husband!
Lie still, and compose yourself! Aunt Verna
will see about the silly creature!” drawing a chair to
his side and overwhelming him with attentions to banish
Jessie from his mind.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the shame-stricken, frantic girl had
rushed past Mrs. Dalrymple’s outstretched arms to the
corridor, and darting past the astonished servant, tore
open the door, and disappeared in the gloom of the
stormy night.</p>

<p>“Follow her, and bring her back by force!” exclaimed
his mistress, in the wildest agitation.</p>

<p>“It is storming wildly, madam. The air is filled
with snow, and it is deep already,” the man objected.</p>

<p>“Go! Bring her back at once! I tell you go!” she
stormed at him, and he obeyed without further parley.</p>

<p>Then her writhing lips parted in incoherent words:</p>

<p>“Oh, God, this pain at my heart! That poor girl,
she was so fatally like my lost daughter, my stolen
child, that I could scarcely refrain from clasping her
in my arms! Oh, if it should be my lost one! But,
no, she said that her mother was dead! Oh, why am
I idling here? I must telephone for a physician to be
on hand when she is brought back. Perhaps her sweet
young life may be saved, and I will make it my care
henceforth for the sake of her haunting likeness to my
lost darling!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Poor Jessie had only carried out her intention on<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
coming to see Laurier, for life held so little charm for
the unfortunate girl now that all who loved her were
dead that in desperation she had resolved to end it
all by suicide, that last resort of the wretched.</p>

<p>In the room she occupied at Madame Barto’s was
a case of medicine, and from it she had selected the
tiny vial labeled “Poison,” and filled with a dark
liquid.</p>

<p>In her agony of shame it was worse to her than if
Laurier had, indeed, been dead. The dark unknown
was welcome to her as the terrible present.</p>

<p>Penniless, friendless, with no one to turn to, she
yet dared not go back to Madame Barto, fearing alike
her wrath at her escape, and the persecutions of her
hated nephew. Crushed beneath the burden of unendurable
despair, she drained the vial, and fled out into
the night and the storm to die.</p>

<p>The black night, inhospitable as the hearts she had
left, greeted her with storm and fury, driving her on
before a furious gale that took away her breath and
tossed her to and fro, at last throwing her down
heavily, and striking her head against the curbing, so
that in a minute she became unconscious, and lay still
at the mercy of the elements.</p>

<p>The icy wind shrieked above her, the snow fell in
thick, white sheets and wrapped her in a shroud of
royal ermine, and thus she lay silent and moveless for
about a quarter of an hour before she was found by
the man Mrs. Dalrymple had sent to seek and bring
her back.</p>

<p>She had barely gone half a square from the mansion,
but in the stormy gloom it was hard to find any one,<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
and he was about to give up the quest in despair of success
when his foot stumbled against a soft body under
the snow.</p>

<p>With a startled cry he stooped down and dragged
her up in his arms, bearing her to a little distance,
where a light gleamed through a window. By its aid
he saw that it was she whom he sought.</p>

<p>“But, poor little girl, she seems as dead as a door-nail!
Howsomever, I’ll carry her back to my mistress,
dead or alive!” he muttered, struggling on with his
inert burden against the raging storm till he gained the
shelter of the mansion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dalrymple was waiting in the wildest anxiety,
the physician having already arrived, and been
told the meager story that a poor young girl had attempted
suicide and rushed out into the storm to die.</p>

<p>“I should like to see the vial and determine the nature
of the poison,” said Doctor Julian gravely, and he
was keenly disappointed when Cora Ellyson confessed
that she had inadvertently trod on it and crushed it,
so that she had to call a servant to remove the fragments.</p>

<p>“That is very unfortunate, as a knowledge of the
poison taken would have materially assisted in finding
the antidote,” he said, and the servant was quickly
summoned by his mistress to bring back the fragments.</p>

<p>The answer was that they had been consumed in the
kitchen range.</p>

<p>Directly afterward the girl’s stiffening body was
brought in and laid down upon the floor before their
eyes&mdash;a hapless sight that wrung anguished groans<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
from Frank Laurier’s lips, though his proud sweetheart
looked on coldly and unmoved, perhaps secretly
glad in her heart of this calamity.</p>

<p>One glance at the pale, cold face in its frame of wet,
disheveled gold, and the physician said sadly:</p>

<p>“Poor child, I can do nothing. She is already
dead!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no, no, do not say such dreadful words!
She must not die!” sobbed Mrs. Dalrymple, giving
way to wild emotion as she knelt by Jessie, tore open
her gown, and felt eagerly for the heart.</p>

<p>“Oh, Doctor Julian, feel here! Is not there some
slight pulsation?” hopefully.</p>

<p>“Not the faintest, my dear madam. The deadly
potion did its work quickly. The lovely girl is dead!
Ah, how remarkable!” bending with a start to examine
a mark on the young girl’s breast where it was exposed
by the open gown.</p>

<p>Doctor Julian was an old man, the family physician,
and he added surprisedly:</p>

<p>“See that red cross on her breast! It is precisely
similar to your family birthmark, and if I mistake not,
you have one like it yourself!”</p>

<p>“Precisely similar, doctor, and on the same spot&mdash;oh,
Heaven, how strange this seems! My lost child&mdash;so
cruelly stolen from me ere I had given her any name
but darling&mdash;had the same mark! What if&mdash;what
if&mdash;&mdash; Oh, my brain reels with wild suspicion. Could
it be&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Calm yourself, my dear madam. This may be but
a coincidence! However, it ought to be investigated
to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[54]</span></p>

<p>“It shall be,” she sobbed, then started as Cora Ellyson
cried impatiently:</p>

<p>“Are you going to leave that dead girl lying there
all night? I declare I shall faint if she is not removed!”</p>

<p>“Cora!” expostulated her lover; but she shrugged
her shoulders haughtily.</p>

<p>Doctor Julian glanced at her in surprise, then said
gently, to Mrs. Dalrymple:</p>

<p>“What disposition will be made of the poor girl’s
body?”</p>

<p>“It shall remain in my care, doctor, and the funeral
shall be in my charge from this house, and at my own
expense,” she sobbed.</p>

<p>Cora Ellyson started forward indignantly, crying:</p>

<p>“Dear aunt, you surely forget that my wedding is
the third day from now. The girl shall not be buried
from here. It would be unseemly amid wedding gayeties!”</p>

<p>“The wedding must be postponed!” the proud
woman sighed, lifting Jessie’s cold little hand and
pressing her lips upon it.</p>

<p>“It shall not. Postponements are unlucky!” Cora
uttered angrily.</p>

<p>“Just a few days, dear&mdash;until next week, say,” whispered
her lover, who could scarcely turn his horrified
gaze from that fair, dead face before him to his pouting
sweetheart.</p>

<p>He was recalling the words Jessie had used in speaking
of Carey Doyle’s frustrated attempt to kiss her
lips:</p>

<p>“I should have died of disgust!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[55]</span></p>

<p>How he had laughed at the idea of any one dying of
a kiss, but looking at that still form on the floor, he
felt as if he had the brand of Cain on his high, white
brow.</p>

<p>“Her death lies at my door!” he thought, in a passion
of remorse.</p>

<p>They bore Jessie tenderly from his presence to a
beautiful white and gold room near Mrs. Dalrymple’s
own, and there the lady’s favorite maid robed the
lovely form for the grave in beautiful white robes fit
for a bride, selected from the wardrobe of her mistress.
Then, laid on a soft, white couch with her golden locks
drifting about her like sunshine on snow, and fragrant
flowers between her waxen hands, she lay like one
asleep in her calm, unearthly beauty.</p>

<p>And by her side Mrs. Dalrymple kept lonely vigil,
distracted by doubts and fears lest this prove to be her
own lost darling restored to her only in death.</p>

<p>Toward midnight a stealthy figure glided in&mdash;Cora
Ellyson, in a crimson silk dressing gown with her
raven hair streaming loose over her shoulders.</p>

<p>“Aunt Verna, you will make yourself sick, staying
up like this! And what is the use?” remonstratingly.</p>

<p>There was no answer from the heavy-eyed woman
brooding over the dead girl’s couch, and Cora continued
eagerly:</p>

<p>“I beg you to reconsider your decision. Send this
body away to the undertaker’s and let the funeral be
from there, so that my wedding need not be overshadowed
by so evil an omen.”</p>

<p>“I cannot grant your request, Cora. The funeral<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
will take place from this house, and your wedding
must be postponed,” came the sad but firm reply.</p>

<p>“I tell you it shall not. I will not be disappointed
for a hysterical sentiment. This poor girl is nothing
to you, nothing! I give you notice that unless you
do as I wish I will remove to-morrow to my Cousin
van Dorn’s and have my wedding from his house
Thursday!”</p>

<p>“Please yourself, Cora, but do not presume to dictate
to me! And now, go; leave me, I prefer to be
alone!” with a flash of spirit.</p>

</div>


<p>Madame Barto did not expect any customers the
next morning; it was so still, so dark and lowering
after the night’s storm, but at ten o’clock the bell
clanged loudly and she admitted a beautiful, richly
dressed woman who said excitedly:</p>

<p>“No, I do not wish my fortune told, but I will pay
you well for any information about a young girl who
has been living with you&mdash;Jessie Lyndon.”</p>

<p>“She ran away from me last night, the little vixen,
and I did not discover it till this morning,” the fortune
teller answered sullenly.</p>

<p>“Do not speak unkindly of the dead. Jessie Lyndon
was found dead in the snow by one of my servants
last night, and she is at my house awaiting burial,”
was the startling reply.</p>

<p>“Good heavens! Poor little thing!” ejaculated Madame
Barto, with a touch of sympathy.</p>

<p>“I have come,” continued the lady, with a quivering
lip, “to get all the information possible about this
young girl’s antecedents.”</p>

<p>“’Tis little I can give you, ma’am, in truth. She
only stayed with me a day or so, but I can give you
the address of Mrs. Ryan, the woman who brought
her to me, and ’tis likely she can tell you all you want
to know, though I don’t think she has any folks rich
enough to bury her, poor thing, and, of course, she has
no claim on me,” added Madame Barto apprehensively.</p>

<p>The caller gave her a haughty glance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[58]</span></p>

<p>“I am not looking for any one to pay Jessie Lyndon’s
burial expenses, my good woman,” she said
freezingly; “Mrs. Ryan’s address, please, and take
this for your trouble,” pressing a gold piece into the
ready palm, and sweeping out to her waiting car.</p>

<p>“Whew! What a highflyer, to be sure! And liberal,
too! I wish I knew her name! There, she’s
dropped a dainty handkerchief! Here ’tis in the corner&mdash;Dalrymple!
The same woman Carey told me
about. I see how it all happened now. She got out
of the window, poor little Jessie, for, after all, she
was a sweet, pretty girl, and went to Fifth Avenue
to find the man she believed dead! Then the blizzard
caught and killed her in sight of the house! I’m free
to own I am sorry, for I wished her no harm, only
when my nephew told me about Mr. Laurier’s angry
sweetheart, I thought just as well to keep Jessie out
of his way for her own good. Well, well, Carey will
be coming presently, and what a fit he will be in when
he learns she is dead, poor Jessie Lyndon!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dalrymple drove straight to Mrs. Ryan’s
house, and found the good little woman at home busy
with her needle. From her she learned enough to convince
her that the hapless girl was no other than her
lost child.</p>

<p>She stayed and listened to the woman’s harrowing
story, and the tears fell in torrents when she learned
all that Jessie, brave little Jessie, so lovely and so ill-fated,
had suffered from the ills of poverty, while her
mother would have given all her millions to find her
lost child, her sole heiress.</p>

<p>All her pride gave way before the humble little<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
woman, who had been kind to the orphan girl, and
she confessed the truth that she was Jessie’s mother,
the woman from whom an angry, unforgiving husband
had stolen away her heart’s idol, her little child.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ryan could not look into that proud, noble
face, and believe she was the bad woman Mrs. Godfrey
suspected. Her kind heart went out to her in
sympathy, and she said:</p>

<p>“It’s been hard lines on yees both, lady, but yees
can make it up to bonny Jessie now!”</p>

<p>“Did I not tell you? Alas, she is dead, my darling!”
And at that moving story Mrs. Ryan’s heart was almost
broken.</p>

<p>“You will come and see her, will you not? She
looks like an angel, so fair, so pure, so peaceful!” the
bereaved mother cried, on leaving, and in her gratitude
for the woman’s kindness to Jessie she pressed on
her a sum of money that seemed like riches itself to
the toil-worn creature whose heart had kept warm and
human through all the trials of pinching poverty.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dalrymple hastened home and found Frank
and Cora together, the latter having just returned
from arranging to celebrate her marriage at her
cousin’s home, instead of here. She was complaining
most bitterly to her lover of her aunt’s injustice, but
he said impatiently:</p>

<p>“Cora, pray do not harp on this subject any more
unless you would have me believe you heartless!”</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed with resentment, but before she
could utter the angry reply that trembled on her lips,
Mrs. Dalrymple swept into the room, and between<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
broken sobs, told them of her cruel discovery of her
child’s identity when all too late to save her life.</p>

<p>“Last night when she stood talking to you so sadly
I was dazed, confused, by a subtle something in her
voice, glance, and gestures that recalled the past,” she
said. “At last it struck me with staggering force that
she reminded me of my divorced husband, while at the
same time she bore a startling resemblance to my lost
child. I was struck dumb with emotion, and could not
move! Then that terrible thing happened. You know
the rest&mdash;how Doctor Julian found on her breast the
family birthmark. To-day it was easy to find the links
in the chain that proved her my own, so long lost to
me, and found, alas, only in&mdash;death!”</p>

<p>The pale, beautiful face drooped upon her breast in
pitiful despair as she cried: “May God send his curse
upon the man who made my life desolate, and robbed
me of my child, my only comfort!”</p>

<p>Frank Laurier’s handsome face was pale with emotion
as he faltered:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Dalrymple, I dare not ask you to forgive me
for my share in your grief, it is beyond pardon. She
did not forgive me, nor can you, I know. I feel that
the sight of me must be hateful to you, so I shall trespass
no longer on your hospitality. I leave to-day,
but I pray you to believe that my undying remorse will
be my bitterest punishment.”</p>

<p>She could well believe it from his pallid face and
dejected mien, but she could not bring the word forgive
to her trembling lips. When she remembered
the previous night and the shame and pain of her hapless
child that had hurried her cruelly out of life she<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
felt like crying out upon him in mad resentment for
what he had done.</p>

<p>As for Cora, she was stunned into silence by the
strange story she had heard.</p>

<p>She dared no longer inveigh against her aunt’s injustice.
She could only bow to the inevitable. But
fully determined not to risk the evil omen of a postponed
marriage, she withdrew to her cousin’s house
that day after forcing herself to utter some meaningless
expressions of sympathy to the relative she was
deserting in her hour of sorrow.</p>

<p>“You must forgive me, but dear Frank is so averse
to a postponement,” she twittered, and Mrs. Dalrymple
did not contradict her, though she knew it was not the
truth.</p>

<p>She had seen within the last few hours a subtle
change pass over the young man.</p>

<p>From being so passionately in love with beautiful
Cora that he was willfully blind to her glaring faults,
a chill seemed to have passed over him, making him
temporarily cold to the fascinating blandishments of
his triumphant betrothed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dalrymple read in his sudden reserve and indifference
that he would not be averse to a postponement
out of sympathy with the house of mourning,
but nothing was further from Cora Ellyson’s selfish
thoughts.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dalrymple also knew something that Cora did
not guess.</p>

<p>When the beautiful, white casket had been borne
into the house some time ago and Jessie’s still form
was laid in it, her golden head pillowed on fragrant<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
flowers after pressing so many thorns in life, Frank
Laurier had gone on his crutch to the room, and spent
half an hour alone with the beautiful dead.</p>

<p>The mother, who watched him, herself unseen, had
seen in his deep-blue eyes, as they rested on her darling’s
face, that look that cannot be mistaken, the dawning
of a great and silent love.</p>

<p>Cora Ellyson’s rival dead was more dangerous to her
peace than in life.</p>

<p>In her grave she would hold the best part of the
heart that Cora claimed as all her own.</p>

<p>The bereaved mother had seen him press reverent
lips on the shining mass of golden hair, had heard him
murmur solemnly: “Jessie, darling, can you hear me
pray for your forgiveness?”</p>

<p>Thursday morning dawned fair and sunny with all
traces of Tuesday night’s storm swept away&mdash;the
streets clean, the skies blue, the air crisply cold&mdash;the
day set for Jessie Lyndon’s funeral and Frank Laurier’s
wedding.</p>

<p>In the grand parlor of Mrs. Dalrymple’s home the
dead girl lay like one asleep, in a white casket banked
with rarest flowers whose delicate perfume pervaded
the whole house. In yesterday’s newspapers a brief
announcement had been made:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Died.</span>&mdash;Suddenly, at her mother’s residence, No.
1512A Fifth Avenue, Tuesday evening, Darling, only
daughter of Mrs. Verna Dalrymple.</p>

<p>“Friends and relatives of the family are respectfully
invited to attend the funeral services from the
family residence, Thursday noon. Interment at Greenwood.”</p>
</div>

<p>In other columns of the newspaper longer paragraphs
were given to the grand noon wedding of the
young millionaire, Frank Laurier, to the brilliant society
belle and heiress, Miss Cora Ellyson. It would
be a grand church wedding and the floral decorations
were superb, while the trousseau, lately arrived from
Paris, was simply magnificent. Pictures of the prospective
bride and groom, intertwined with true-lovers’
knots, were duly printed for the benefit of an admiring
public.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[64]</span></p>

<p>As the hour of noon drew near, Mrs. Dalrymple’s
house was filled with sympathetic guests, to whose
ears had floated rumors of the sad ending of her long
grief for her stolen child&mdash;recovered only in death.
When they saw Darling Dalrymple in her coffin&mdash;her
mother had never given her any name but Darling&mdash;they
wept in sympathy with the bereaved heart from
whom this lovely treasure had been so cruelly wrested
by the grim King of Terrors.</p>

<p>The beautiful Episcopal service was read, the mother’s
farewell kiss pressed on the cold, white brow, the
casket closed, and borne out to the white-plumed
hearse, the carriages were filled with the mother and
friends, and the solemn cortège moved away to Greenwood,
where the grim family vault had been opened to
receive another scion of the old house of Van Dorn,
the fairest of all its fair daughters.</p>

<p>At the same time only a block away, on the same
avenue, a bridal train was leaving the Van Dorn mansion
for the church.</p>

<p>Life and death jostling each other almost side by
side!</p>

<p>In one carriage sat the bride, with her cousins, the
Van Dorns, and her dark, brilliant beauty was at its
best, enhanced by the snowy bridal robes and the joy
that flashed from her eyes at the thought that she
would soon be the bride of the man she adored.</p>

<p>Laurier and his best man were to meet them at the
church, the bridegroom having recovered sufficiently
from his sprain that he could walk without a crutch.</p>

<p>In the sunshine of the brilliant day the two processions
met and passed each other, the bridal train and<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
the funeral cortège&mdash;Cora going to her bridal, her
rival to her grave!</p>

<p>The bride’s eyes were riveted on the white, flower-banked
casket, and her florid color faded to ashen
pallor while she shrank back shuddering:</p>

<p>“It is an evil omen to meet a corpse on the way to
one’s wedding!”</p>

<p>“Do not give way to such fancies, dear,” Mrs. van
Dorn answered soothingly, but she also grew pale with
superstition, though having heard all about Jessie from
Cora, she thought inwardly:</p>

<p>“Though it is evil-omened to meet a funeral on the
way to one’s wedding, yet I fancy Cora is more fortunate
to meet her rival dead than living. Though
Frank Laurier treated that poor girl very badly, I believe
that a secret remorse is gnawing at his heart, and
if she had lived, who knows how it all might have
turned out? Frank Laurier has appeared very strange
to me these past two days&mdash;pale, distrait, and sad&mdash;the
result of keen remorse, no doubt, but does he love
Cora as well as before, I wonder! This encounter
with the dead girl has shaken my nerves, and I feel
uneasy. I wish the wedding was well over, and the
knot safely tied for Cora’s sake. I hope he will be
sure to meet us promptly at the church!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dalrymple, throwing back her heavy veil for
air, gasped with surprise and wonder.</p>

<p>She could not have dreamed of seeing Frank Laurier
at the funeral services at the Van Dorn vault
when it was the hour for his wedding at old Trinity.</p>

<p>Yet there he stood in their midst, his handsome head
bowed reverently, his face pale, his eyes heavy with
grief&mdash;he who should be so happy in this his bridal
hour!</p>

<p>Catching her startled glance, he moved to her side,
whispering sadly:</p>

<p>“I could not stay away, but I shall be in time to meet
Cora at Trinity. Ah, how my heart aches with this
cruel blow! Let me love you as a son for her dear
sake!”&mdash;he paused, with a long-drawn sigh, for the
venerable bishop was beginning the last sad rites:
“Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.”</p>

<p>Soon they had to come away and leave her there
alone, sweet Jessie, among her dead kindred, she whose
brief life had been so sad and lonely, ending with so
cruel a tragedy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[67]</span></p>

<p>Frank Laurier, accompanied by his best man, Ernest
Noel, returned to their coupé, and outside the cemetery
limits ordered the coachman to proceed as fast
as possible to old Trinity to meet the bridal party.</p>

<p>Noel thought that this attendance on a funeral in
the very hour of his marriage was a very strange freak
on the part of his friend, and he was puzzled yet more
by the gravity and sadness of Laurier’s face as they
drove swiftly along toward the church.</p>

<p>But having no clew to the enigma, he tried to dismiss
it from his mind, glancing at his watch and
saying:</p>

<p>“By George, we are due at Trinity now, and it would
be shocking to get there late&mdash;a slight the bride would
not easily forgive!”</p>

<p>He was astonished that Laurier made no reply, sitting
pale and grave and seemingly indifferent in his
seat as if he had not heard.</p>

<p>Noel shrugged his shoulders, and called to the coachman:</p>

<p>“Drive as fast as you dare. We are already late!”</p>

<p>Thereupon the horse was urged to a higher rate of
speed, and presently there was a commotion outside,
and the coupé stopped.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” inquired Noel, putting his
head outside, and thus encountering a burly policeman.</p>

<p>“You are under arrest for fast driving,” grunted
the guardian of the law.</p>

<p>“But, good heavens, man, you must not detain us.
It is necessary for us to drive fast in order to reach<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
old Trinity for a wedding ceremony,” expostulated
Noel.</p>

<p>“Wedding or no wedding, all three of you must
come to the station house with me,” answered the
policeman, who was both surly and dull-witted.</p>

<p>Laurier suddenly aroused himself to the situation,
and united his expostulations to Noel’s, but all to no
avail.</p>

<p>The policeman would not hear to letting them go.
He said to himself he would “teach them young bloods
a lesson.” He did not credit at all the story of the
wedding party waiting at the church.</p>

<p>Laurier, suddenly realizing the situation, and thinking
of Cora’s anger and mortification at having to
wait for him so long, grew frantic.</p>

<p>He whispered to Noel:</p>

<p>“Would it be any use to offer him a bribe to let us
go?”</p>

<p>“No, he is so malicious he would get us indicted
for trying to bribe him in the discharge of duty.”</p>

<p>Laurier turned to the stubborn policeman, asking
politely:</p>

<p>“Could you not take our names and let us report
to the police court to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“They may do that at the station house, but I am
obliged to arrest you and take you there. Come, the
longer you parley the more time you are losing! I’ll
just jump up with your driver so we can lose no
time.”</p>

<p>Noel whispered excitedly:</p>

<p>“Suppose we cut and run while he is getting on
the box? We could easily get a cab.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[69]</span></p>

<p>“Done!” And they slipped out unperceived on
either side, to the vast amusement of a good-natured
crowd that had collected on the corner.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the policeman caught the snickering
at his expense, just as the coupé drove off, and turned
his red head curiously back, at once catching sight of
the fugitives.</p>

<p>“Stop!” he shouted angrily, springing down to follow.</p>

<p>A hot chase ensued, but as the sympathies of the
spectators were all with the handsome young men, the
poor policeman got no assistance, and presently he was
outdistanced by the agile sprinters, and gave up the
pursuit just a minute too soon, for, in turning a corner
at breakneck speed, Frank Laurier collided with a bicycle
and went down like a rock.</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” cried Ernest Noel, stopping short
in horror above the wreck, the shattered wheel, and
the two prostrate men.</p>

<p>They had both sustained injuries, but the rider directly
got up on his feet, and declared himself all right
save for a few bruises.</p>

<p>Not so with Frank Laurier, who lay like one dead
before them, with his fair, handsome face upturned
to the light, his eyes closed, and a dark bruise on the
side of his temple, showing where he had struck it in
falling against the curbstone. All efforts to revive him
failed, and a physician who was called declared it was
a case of concussion of the brain and that the patient
must be removed at once to Bellevue Hospital.</p>

<p>“No, no&mdash;he is”&mdash;began Ernest Noel quickly, but
at that moment the red-headed policeman trotted on<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
the scene with a bewildered air, awakening such instant
fierce resentment in his breast that he sprang at him,
exclaiming hotly:</p>

<p>“You red-headed villain, you are the cause of all
this trouble! I should like to throttle you!”</p>

<p>Whereupon the indignant officer raised his club and
brought it down on the cranium of the hot-headed
young man with such telling effect that he was quite
stunned, and fell an easy victim to arrest, being removed
in an ambulance to the station house, while his
poor friend, whose identity was equally unknown, was
taken to Bellevue Hospital.</p>

<p>What an ending to a day that had been anticipated
for months with the ardor of a true lover. Instead
of wedding bells the slow procession to the grave, and
now&mdash;far from the festal scene, alone among strangers
who did not suspect his identity with the young millionaire
Frank Laurier, terribly injured, perhaps unto
death, how strange and sad a fate!</p>

<p>And the bride&mdash;poor girl!&mdash;so beautiful, so proud,
so imperious, who can picture the depths of her pain
and humiliation, waiting more than an hour at the
thronged, fashionable church for a laggard bridegroom
who never came, who sent no excuse, who left
her to suffer under one of the cruelest blows woman’s
heart can bear&mdash;forsaken at the altar!</p>

<p>She was taken home again by her relatives, a pallid,
wild-eyed, half-frantic girl, vowing bitterest vengeance
on her recreant lover as she stripped the bridal
veil from her dark, queenly head, and tramped it
angrily beneath her feet.</p>

<p>“Thus I trample on the past, on all the love I bore<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
him, and vow myself to vengeance!” she cried madly,
to her cousin, Mrs. van Dorn, whose eyes filled with
sympathetic tears as she cried:</p>

<p>“It is a cruel blow, dear Cora, but do not be too
rash in your anger. Perhaps something happened to
prevent Frank’s coming and everything may yet be
explained to your satisfaction.”</p>

<p>But her consoling words rang hollow in her own
ears, for she thought:</p>

<p>“I had a presentiment of this on the way to the
church. I felt certain that he would fail to meet Cora
there. Oh, it was very cruel in him to wound the
poor girl so. It is a disgrace that will cling to a
girl through life, being jilted at the altar. How much
kinder it would have been to break with her sooner
and avoid a public exposé like the painful one we
have had to-day. I feel almost as indignant as Cora
at the slight put on our family!”</p>

<p>Later on her husband looked in at the dressing-room
door, saying kindly:</p>

<p>“How is Cora, poor child? I have something to
tell her about Laurier if I may come in!”</p>

<p>“Speak quickly!” cried the half-distraught girl, turning
almost fiercely upon him. “Has anything happened
to the wretch?”</p>

<p>“I was just about to say that I just now met Hazelton,
and he told me he saw Laurier and Noel at Greenwood
when the funeral services over your aunt’s
daughter were concluded at the vault.”</p>

<p>“At her funeral&mdash;in our bridal hour! False, wicked
wretch! I will never forgive him, never! May the
curse of a forsaken bride blight his life from now to<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
the grave! May the cruelest misfortunes of life overtake
him!” raved the insulted girl in the madness of
her wounded love and pride.</p>

<p>“Be calm, Cora, I shall avenge this slight to you,”
her cousin said angrily, and just then he received a
summons from downstairs.</p>

<p>It was sunset, and Ernest Noel, very pale and
shaken, had just been released on bail and come to
bring them the news of all that had happened to prevent
Laurier from meeting his bride at the altar&mdash;lying
instead at a hospital at the point of death.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">WAVES OF MEMORY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When Laurier and Noel had both been taken away,
the man whose bicycle had been the cause of their
calamity stood alone among the curious onlookers gazing
somewhat ruefully at the ruin of his wheel.</p>

<p>He was a fair-haired, fine-looking gentleman approaching
middle age, and his blue eyes had in them a
grave, sad expression, as of one who had looked on
the sadder side of life.</p>

<p>To one and another he put the question: “Who
were those two young men?”</p>

<p>No one could give him any satisfaction, and he was
turning away, leaving the broken wheel to its fate
when a reporter approached the scene, observing:</p>

<p>“I should like to get your name, sir, for my report
of this accident for my evening paper.”</p>

<p>“Ah!&mdash;say John Smith,” the stranger returned impatiently,
walking quickly away from his interlocutor
and disappearing down a side street.</p>

<p>He stopped presently in a café for a glass of wine
to settle his shaken nerves.</p>

<p>He could not get out of his mind the handsome, unconscious
face of Laurier as it lay upturned to the
winter sunlight after the shocking accident.</p>

<p>“I would give all I own if it had not happened,” he
thought sorrowfully; “although I know I am not to
blame, for he dashed into me full tilt as we turned
the corner; still, I feel in a way responsible, and I<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
shall go to-morrow to Bellevue to inquire about his
case, and to lend any financial aid required. But that
will scarcely be necessary, I suppose, as both the young
fellows were most expensively dressed as if for some
elegant social function&mdash;perhaps a noon reception or
wedding. The mysterious part of the affair is, what
were they doing sprinting along the streets in that
garb, and pursued by a policeman?”</p>

<p>He finished his wine, tipped the obsequious waiter,
took a cigar, and strolled into the reading room to
smoke.</p>

<p>As the blue wreaths of smoke curled over his fair
head thrown carelessly back, exposing the clear-cut,
spirited features, his thoughts ran thus:</p>

<p>“What an unlucky devil I am, anyway! If the Fates
had had any mercy, they would have stretched me dead
on the sidewalk instead of that handsome youth who
doubtless had much in life to live for&mdash;everything,
perhaps, that I have not&mdash;youth, love, happiness, home,
while I am a lonely wanderer on the face of the earth.
To her, false heart, I owe it all! Can I ever forgive
her heartless desertion?”</p>

<p>A heavy frown came between his brows as he continued:</p>

<p>“What a return after my years of exile and toil&mdash;my
sister and her husband dead, their children and
my precious daughter lost to me in the mazes of this
great, wicked city. For a week now I have vainly
sought to trace them, but since my sister’s death and
her husband’s removal I can find no trace save the
item accidentally read in the <cite>World</cite> of John Lyndon’s<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
accident and death. I have been to the hospital where
he died, but they can give me no clew to his family.
He was buried at the city’s expense, they said, so they
must be in the direst poverty. Oh, what a cruel fate
must be theirs, dear little ones! Oh, my Jessie, my
bright-eyed darling, I wronged you after all in taking
my revenge on her! You would have fared better in
her care. Oh, if God will only let me find you, my
sweet one, I will make it up to you by such devotion
as the world never knew! Jessie! Jessie!” and his
head sank on his hands while the fire of his cigar went
out in ashes.</p>

<p>Again he lifted his head with a start at the sound of
a footstep. Other men were entering. They must not
find him moping like a woman.</p>

<p>He took up a newspaper and looked over it at random.
It bore yesterday’s date, but that did not matter.
He was only pretending to read.</p>

<p>The column of deaths came before his eyes, and
almost mechanically he read the first funeral notice:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Died.</span>&mdash;Suddenly, at her mother’s residence, No.
1512A Fifth Avenue, Tuesday evening, Darling, only
daughter of Mrs. Verna Dalrymple.</p>

<p>“Friends and relatives of the family are respectfully
invited to attend the funeral services from the
family residence, Thursday noon. Interment at
Greenwood.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Merciful Heaven!”</p>

<p>The words breathed low and faintly over the man’s
suddenly blanched lips, and the paper shook in his
nervous grasp while his eyes stared in a sort of incredulous<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
horror at the printed words that moved
him so.</p>

<p>Thoughts flew like lightning through his brain:</p>

<p>“Darling Dalrymple! What does it mean? It cannot
be possible that she ever recovered the child! No,
for the poor, kindly folk who were at my poor sister’s
deathbed told me of her lovely, gentle daughter,
golden-haired Jessie, with the big, soft, dark eyes and
the tender, rosy lips, to whom the mother clung in dying,
bidding her be a little mother to Mark and Willie.
No, it could not be Jessie. She has most likely adopted
a child in place of her lost daughter&mdash;a child that death
has taken away!”</p>

<p>He remained silently musing with his eyes on the
death notice till every printed word seemed photographed
on his brain.</p>

<p>“Verna Dalrymple&mdash;Darling Dalrymple! How
strange that she did not throw away the name with all
the rest that it stood for&mdash;fickle heart! I suppose she
had to keep it for the child’s sake, sweet little Jessie!
Ah, how strange we never guessed she was coming!
If we had known how different all might have been! I
must have been more patient of her fretting, she more
tender of my restlessness under misfortune! The dear
little one coming must have held our hearts together&mdash;hearts
now so terribly sundered!” And Leon Dalrymple
bowed his fair head heavily while waves of
memory swept across his heart.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">FORGETFULNESS, THE GREAT PANACEA.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>A lonely life and much brooding inclines the mind
to strange aspects.</p>

<p>Leon Dalrymple’s thoughts dwelt persistently on the
dead girl&mdash;his divorced wife’s adopted daughter as he
believed.</p>

<p>He felt a painful, almost jealous curiosity over her,
wondering if she had usurped the love that belonged
to Jessie as well as her place in her mother’s home.</p>

<p>“I should like to look upon her face!” he repeated
over and over to himself, and the desire grew at last
into a bold determination.</p>

<p>The early autumn twilight found him at the cemetery,
whispering into the ear of the feeble old sexton
who recoiled with surprise at his proposition:</p>

<p>“No, sir, no, it would be as much as my place is
worth! I can’t do it!” he protested, but the clink of
gold made him change his opinion.</p>

<p>“It is nothing, after all&mdash;only to give me one look
at the dead girl’s face! What could they do to you
even if they discovered the truth?” Dalrymple repeated
impatiently, and he redoubled his bribe.</p>

<p>The cupidity of the old man made him falter in
his opposition, and as a result they entered the vault
just as the darkness of night settled over the earth,
the sexton carrying a dark lantern, whose glare he
turned on the bank of flowers that surrounded the<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
casket, blending their rich, rare odors with the noisome
odors of mortality.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">The dead are in their silent graves,
</div><div class="indent0">And the earth is cold above;
</div><div class="indent0">And the living weep and sigh
</div><div class="indent0">Over dust that once was love!
</div></div></div></div>

<p>They advanced toward the casket, but suddenly each
recoiled and glared at the other.</p>

<p>“What was that? It sounded like a stifled moan!”
exclaimed Dalrymple, in alarm.</p>

<p>“Nothing but the wind in the trees,” exclaimed the
old sexton, recovering himself, and wrenching loose
the lid of the casket, sending out gusts of rich fragrance
from the covering of tuberoses.</p>

<p>A moment more, and the casket was open, Dalrymple
advancing with a quickened heartthrob to gaze
on the silent sleeper.</p>

<p>It was a startling scene.</p>

<p>The old vault dark and grim, with rows of dead-and-gone
aristocrats ranged around, in the center the
bier banked with flowers, supporting the casket that
held&mdash;not a dead girl, but a living one, for as the two
men gazed with bated breath on the exquisite face, a
second low moan sounded on the air, and then a pair
of large, soft, wondering, dark eyes opened suddenly,
and gazed up into their startled faces!</p>

<p>It was enough to shake the nerves of the strongest
man, to see the dead thus suddenly come to life, and
the old sexton was not strong&mdash;in fact, he had suffered
for years from an organic disease of the heart.</p>

<p>So the shock was more than his weak heart could
bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[79]</span></p>

<p>His face changed to an ashen hue, his old eyes dilated
wildly, his frame shook like a leaf in the wind,
his knees knocked together, and finally, with an awful
groan, he sank in a senseless heap on the floor of the
vault.</p>

<p>Dalrymple took no heed of the old man’s fate. All
his attention was riveted on the girl struggling back
to life from her place among the dead.</p>

<p>It was no strange face that he gazed on, for years
ago he had kissed a fair, childish face with lineaments
like these, as he placed the little one in his tender sister’s
arms, saying:</p>

<p>“Call her Jessie Lyndon, after yourself, dear, and
train her up to be noble and loving and true, as you
have always been. I would not have her brought up
by her proud, rich, heartless mother, who deserted me
for my poverty, but rather as you have been, dear, to
make a loving wife to your husband through all reverses.
I leave her in your care, and I will send you
ample money for her support, but Heaven alone knows
whether I shall ever return to the land where I have
suffered such a cruel shipwreck of my happiness.”</p>

<p>That was twelve long years ago that he had wreaked
what he believed justifiable revenge on a heartless wife,
goaded by ceaseless brooding on his wrongs that had
well-nigh turned his brain. Then he had exiled himself
from his native land and became a lonely wanderer.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="indent0">I go, but whereso’er I flee
</div><div class="indent0">There’s not an eye will weep for me.

</div></div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[80]</span></p>

<p>He had but one solace, and that was in his art.
Music had always been a passion with him until love
had become its rival. Now Cupid had fled, he turned
back to his old love. Drifting to Germany, he found
congenial friends, and for some years made a meager
living for himself and child, sending all he could spare
to America for his golden-haired darling.</p>

<p>Then came that long, long illness that swallowed up
almost a year of his life in a hospital&mdash;that strange
illness that baffled the learned physicians, some declaring
it was melancholy madness, others an unaccountable
loss of memory, but all agreeing that it must have
been brought about by long brooding over something
that had become almost a monomania.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">The whirlwind followed upon my brain and beat my thoughts to rack,
</div><div class="indent0">Who knows how many a month I lay ere memory floated back?
</div></div></div></div>

<p>When strength slowly returned and with it some
glimmerings of painful memory, a clever man, the
wisest physician at the hospital, said to him:</p>

<p>“You have been strangely ill, and the wisest among
us could not rightly name your disease, but it was next
door to madness. I have studied your case with keen
interest, and I learn that you are a lonely man much
given to brooding and moping. Am I right in suspecting
that you have a hopeless sorrow hidden in
your past?”</p>

<p>Leon Dalrymple could only bend his blond, curly
head in silent assent.</p>

<p>“I knew it,” said the wise physician, and he added
kindly:</p>

<p>“Cease brooding over this ill that you cannot remedy,<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
for that way madness lies. Forgetfulness is the
only panacea for a hopeless grief. You are a musician,
they tell me. Give it up for a more practical life. The
greatest bard in the world has written that music is the
food of love. Thus it only ministers to your sorrow.
Cast it aside for a totally different life. If you were
strong enough, I should say try manual labor, that in
exhausting the body, dulls and wearies the mind, curing
its ills of brooding and melancholy. Try the Australian
gold fields. Get rich and practical.”</p>

<p>The patient took his advice.</p>

<p>After years of toil and travel, when body and
mind were both restored, he had permitted himself to
dwell again with yearning memory on the past.</p>

<p>He was aghast when he counted up twelve years
since he had come away.</p>

<p>“I must go home to my little Jessie!” he cried.</p>

<p>He had kissed her as a child and gone away&mdash;he
found her again almost a woman, lying among funeral
flowers in her soft, white shroud, but, thank Heaven,
with the breath of life faintly heaving her bosom, and
dawning in the dark of her tender eyes.</p>

<p>“Jessie, Jessie!” he cried, in a transport of joy, but
she knew him not; her glance was dazed and frightened
at her grim, unfamiliar surroundings.</p>

<p>It came to him suddenly that if she recovered consciousness
fully and found she had been buried alive
the shock might be too great for her reason.</p>

<p>She had closed her eyes again with a tired sigh, so
he lifted her tenderly from her white satin bed, and
bearing her outside, wrapped her carefully in his long,
dark overcoat.</p>

</div>


<p>Rapid thoughts were revolving in his mind:</p>

<p>“I will take her far away from New York, my precious
daughter, and her mother shall never know that
she is not lying in the old vault among her dead-and-gone
kindred, the proud Van Dorns. The rest of her
sweet life shall belong to the plebian father her mother
despised.”</p>

<p>Suddenly he remembered the old sexton lying, as
he supposed, in a heavy swoon on the floor of the
vault.</p>

<p>“Can I purchase his silence?” he wondered, laying
Jessie’s quiet form down on the dry grass while he returned
to the vault.</p>

<p>It gave him a shock to find that the old man was
quite dead, but directly he began to perceive that the
sudden death would help his plans materially.</p>

<p>“Poor old man, I am very sorry about it, but it
makes my secret safe. Now, I will lay him with the
lantern and the vault keys some distance away in one
of the paths, so that when he is found in the morning
no one will suspect what has happened here,” he
thought, as he lifted the frame of the old man and
bore it some distance away, placing beside it the lantern
and keys as if he had fallen dead on the spot.</p>

<p>“God rest his soul!” he murmured, bending over
the still form and placing in his inner coat pocket a
sum of money more than sufficient to defray his burial
expenses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[83]</span></p>

<p>“For who knows but he may have left a widow
and orphans who will mourn bitterly to-morrow when
he is found here dead,” he thought, with a sigh, as he
turned from the spot, returning to Jessie, who lay
faintly breathing, but not yet fully conscious, on the
grass.</p>

<p>“Now to get safely away from here before she
awakes and realizes the horror of her position,” he
muttered, fastening the long overcoat tightly around
her to conceal her white robes as he bore her in his
arms out of the beautiful cemetery, past glimmering
statues marking the last repose of world-worn hearts.</p>

<p>Once safely in the street, he ventured to call a taxicab,
explaining to the chauffeur, who looked suspiciously
at his strange burden, that his daughter had
fainted in the street while they were on their way to a
little party.</p>

<p>“Just drive about the streets a while until I give
you further orders,” he said, wishing to gain time to
think.</p>

<p>To carry Jessie in this garb and condition to any
hotel, he knew, would bring upon him a suspicion he
was unwilling to face, so he racked his brain in the endeavor
to decide where to go with his charge.</p>

<p>In his extremity he thought of the woman by whom
the Lyndons had once lived, and who had told him of<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
his sister’s death and the removal of the bereaved
family to so distant a part of the city that she had
quite lost track of them. The woman was widowed
and lived alone in a poor cottage of her own, so it
was the safest refuge he could find for Jessie.</p>

<p>To this kindly soul he went in his trouble, and was
received with motherly cordiality.</p>

<p>Preferring not to tell her the actual truth, he satisfied
her curiosity with a plausible story, and soon had
Jessie disrobed and placed in a warm, comfortable
bed.</p>

<p>But though the woman who had dearly loved Jessie
always called her by every fond, endearing name, no
light of recognition shone in the dazed, dark eyes. By
morning they found that she was really ill, and needed
a physician.</p>

<p>“She has had a fall and perhaps injured her brain&mdash;however,
I can tell better by to-morrow,” said the
man of healing.</p>

<p>Acting on this clever diagnosis, his treatment of the
case was so correct that within three days the light of
reason returned to Jessie’s eyes.</p>

<p>It was a fact that the fall on the pavement and
striking her head had more seriously injured Jessie
than the drug she had taken, the latter having only
induced a long, deep sleep, very like its “twin brother
death.”</p>

<p>Leon Dalrymple watched by her bedside with passionate
devotion, feeling that he had at last something
to live for in this beautiful daughter restored to
him as from the dead.</p>

<p>While she still lay ill without having recognized<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
any one around her, he provided the Widow Doyle
with a full purse and sent her out to buy a fine outfit.</p>

<p>“We are going away on a journey, my daughter
and I,” he said. “She must have a large trunkful of
good clothing suitable to a young lady of moderate
fortune&mdash;nothing gaudy or cheap, but of fine material,
and of the best make.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Doyle was a woman of excellent taste, and she
fitted Jessie out well with clothing of the best style,
so that when she was well enough to sit up she could
while away the hours of convalescence by admiring
her pretty, new things.</p>

<p>The day came when she opened wide her beautiful
eyes with the light of reason shining in them, and saw
sitting by the bed a handsome, fair-haired man, who
had about him a subtle fascination that instantly drew
her heart.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” she whispered faintly.</p>

<p>He turned and took her hand.</p>

<p>“Have you never heard of your absent father, dear
little Jessie?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Are you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am your father, dearest. Will you kiss
me?”</p>

<p>She held up her sweet face passively and gave him
a child’s dutiful kiss, murmuring plaintively:</p>

<p>“And my mother?”</p>

<p>A dark frown gloomed his brow as he retorted
angrily:</p>

<p>“We will never speak of her, Jessie. She is as one
dead to us both.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">DALRYMPLE’S SECRET.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Jessie’s large, soft, dark eyes turned on her father’s
face with a look that shook his soul, they were so like
other eyes he had once loved.</p>

<p>She cried pleadingly:</p>

<p>“No, no, for I have had such a sweet dream of my
mother it thrills my heart yet. Let me tell it to you,
papa!”</p>

<p>The dark eyes and the pleading voice pierced his
heart like a knife.</p>

<p>Why had God given her this subtle likeness to her
mother that would always be like a thorn in his
heart?</p>

<p>He could not answer for his tumultuous thoughts,
and she continued thrillingly:</p>

<p>“Such a strange dream, papa!&mdash;sweet and strange,
for I seemed to be dead, but I felt no sorrow for it,
because life had been cruel to me, and I was glad to
be at rest. Then she seemed to come and stand by my
side, the mother I had never known till an hour before
my death, when I saw her only as a proud, rich
stranger. But in death she seemed to belong to me.
She knelt by me and kissed my face, my hands, my
hair; she called me Darling, and her tears rained on
me while she deplored the cruel fate that parted us
in life, and restored me to her only in death. Tell me,
papa, could this be true? This proud, beautiful lady,
was she my mother?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[87]</span></p>

<p>He had listened in surprise and wonder, and now
he said evasively:</p>

<p>“It was only a dream, you know, dear.”</p>

<p>“Only a dream&mdash;but I hoped it might prove a
reality. I&mdash;I&mdash;loved her so dearly in my dream because
she was so sweet and tender,” faltered the girl
with tears of disappointment starting to her eyes while
her father gazed at her in secret wonder, longing to
know what strange events had preceded her supposed
death.</p>

<p>He could not bear to see her yearning for the mother
who had been so cruel to the father, but he did not
know how to change that instinct of love; he could
only say coldly:</p>

<p>“Do not think any more of your dream, child. It
was very misleading.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so,” she murmured humbly, believing it
must be true what he said, for she could recall another
dream that was, indeed, too subtly sweet to be aught
but illusion.</p>

<p>In that strange dream a voice all too fatally dear
to her heart had murmured words of love and tenderness,
vowing fealty to her in heaven:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">I love you, dearest one, all the while,
</div><div class="indent1">My heart is as full as it can hold,

</div><div class="indent1">And the red young mouth and the hair’s young gold,
</div><div class="indent0">So, hush, I will give you this leaf to keep,
</div><div class="indent1">See, I shut it inside the sweet, cold hand&mdash;
</div><div class="indent0">There, that is our secret! go to sleep;
</div><div class="indent1">You will wake, and remember and understand.
</div></div></div></div>

<p>In that lovely dream he&mdash;Frank Laurier&mdash;had
pressed his lips on her golden hair, had kissed a rose<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
and crushed it between her folded hands. Was it only
a dream?</p>

<p>Yes, how could it be aught but a dream? He who
had trifled with her, scorned her while living, how
could he have changed when she lay dead?</p>

<p>The tears brimmed over in her eyes as she thought:</p>

<p>“How foolish I am, dwelling on such fancies. Of
course, I have been ill&mdash;not dead!&mdash;and dreamed all
about these people who care naught for me.”</p>

<p>Leon Dalrymple took her hand and looked at her
with tender pity.</p>

<p>“My dear little one, do you feel well enough to go
back with me over the cruel past?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>She assented eagerly, and with some evasions that
he deemed necessary, he gave her a brief résumé of
his life.</p>

<p>“I shall not tell you what your mother’s name was&mdash;nor
mine&mdash;I call myself Leon Lyndon now,” he said
curtly, continuing: “Suffice it to say you were born
after your mother deserted me in disgust at my poverty.
I did not suspect you were coming, and, if she
guessed it, she selfishly kept the tender secret. You
were born, and became the joy and pride of her life
while I hated her for having deprived me of your
love. I believe I was half mad in my troubles those
days, and I contrived to see you often unsuspected by
your mother, while you were out with your nurse.
Your baby beauty and sweetness grew upon me so that
at last I stole you away, gloating over the thought that
I could punish her at last for her cruelty to me. I
took you to my dear, sweet sister Jessie, left you in
her care, and became an exile from my native land.<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
The story of those twelve years is too long for you
now, but at length the longing for you drew me back
again to New York, where I searched for you vainly
for a week before I chanced on you at last.”</p>

<p>“You found me lying like one dead in the snow!”
she cried, and he started, answering evasively:</p>

<p>“How came you there, my darling? I am very anxious
to hear your story up to that point.”</p>

<p>To his surprise she burst into tears, sobbing unrestrainedly
for several moments.</p>

<p>He waited patiently, stroking the fair head tenderly
till the healing tears ceased to flow, then, little by little,
he drew her on, until the story of her young life and
her piteous little love secret lay bare before his eyes.</p>

<p>He was startled, touched, and pained; the tears were
very near his eyes.</p>

<p>He kissed her tenderly, pityingly.</p>

<p>“It was very sad, my child, but you are so young you
will soon get over this sorrow. It was rash in you to
try to throw away your life like that, and I am very
glad that I found you in your extremity and placed
you in a physician’s care, else your life must have paid
the forfeit of your desperate deed,” he said rapidly, determining
in his mind that she should never know
what had happened to her that night after she fell
down in the snow and thought herself dying.</p>

<p>“But life is very sad,” she murmured plaintively.
“He&mdash;he&mdash;will marry that scornful beauty, Miss Ellyson,
and&mdash;and&mdash;they will laugh together many times
over me&mdash;and my broken heart.”</p>

<p>The tears came again in a burning shower, but he<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
was glad to see them fall; he knew they would relieve
her pain of wounded love and pride.</p>

<p>When she grew quiet he said tenderly:</p>

<p>“You must forget him, dear, as they will forget you
in their happiness. I will take you away from New
York, where you shall never meet those cruel hearts
again.”</p>

<p>“I should like to go&mdash;I should like to forget!” she
sighed, and his heart throbbed with divine sympathy,
for he knew well all the anguish of her plaint.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">LAURIER’S ATONEMENT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When two people are of the same mind that certain
subjects are painful, they are not apt to recall
them to each other’s memory.</p>

<p>Leon Lyndon, as he chose to call himself, left New
York within the week with his strangely recovered
daughter, and in new pursuits and pleasures both
sought oblivion of the painful past.</p>

<p>Lyndon had become rich while at the gold fields,
and he spared no expense on Jessie.</p>

<p>Finding that in her restless mood she enjoyed
travel more than anything else, they spent six months
wandering over their native land, enjoying its beauties
and grandeur, unsurpassed by any other country
in the world.</p>

<p>Then they crossed the ocean and resumed their
migratory habits.</p>

<p>Another six months were spent in this way, then
a weariness fell on both and they longed for rest.</p>

<p>The father decided to settle in Germany for a year
and cultivate his daughter’s mind.</p>

<p>He had already discovered to his delight that she
had inherited his great talent for music, together with
a voice of rare power and melody.</p>

<p>Securing the best teachers that money could procure,
they spent eighteen quiet months in the polishing
of Jessie’s mind, and father and daughter became
passionately attached to each other, finding in this
warm affection some balm for past sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[92]</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lyndon had kept from his daughter
one fact that she would doubtless have found very interesting&mdash;the
story of the accident that had prevented
the marriage of Frank Laurier at the appointed time.</p>

<p>He had read in the next day’s papers the story of
the interrupted marriage&mdash;the bride’s long wait at the
church, the mysterious failure of the bridegroom to
arrive, the bride’s mortification and her return home&mdash;then
the solution of the mystery in the accident that
had befallen Laurier, nearly costing him his life, as it
was stated that he was lingering between life and death
with concussion of the brain.</p>

<p>Leon Lyndon immediately comprehended that he
had been the cause of the trouble by running into Laurier
with his wheel, and though it had been unavoidable,
he felt a keen remorse and regret for his part in
the tragedy, although he owed the victim no sympathy,
seeing what grief he had brought upon his daughter.</p>

<p>These facts Lyndon thought it prudent to conceal
from Jessie, supposing that the marriage would take
place anyhow, as soon as the condition of the bridegroom
improved, so the name was tacitly dropped between
them, and after they left New York remained
unspoken, if unforgotten.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, matters were quite different in New
York from what either he or Jessie could have supposed.</p>

<p>Laurier, after his accident, had remained for several
days in a serious condition, recovering consciousness
so slightly as not to be able to recognize the
friends who were permitted to visit him. Having no
relatives in the city, his dearest friend, Ernest Noel,<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
was often by his bedside, and it was quite a week before
the latter dared answer the half-dazed questions
put to him by the sick man.</p>

<p>Then full consciousness dawned, and all the cruel
truth came upon him.</p>

<p>The funeral, the accident, the interrupted wedding,
all dawned on his mind, and a hollow groan burst from
him as he turned his eyes on Noel.</p>

<p>“Cora&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Noel read the pained questioning in the one word.
The stricken bridegroom was thinking of Cora and
the cruel ordeal she had been called on to bear, the
interrupted wedding, the gossip, the nine days’ wonder.</p>

<p>“She is well,” Noel said encouragingly.</p>

<p>“Tell me all about that day,” Laurier pleaded
faintly, and his friend obeyed with some evasions.</p>

<p>Not for worlds would he have betrayed the whispers
he had heard of the proud bride’s fury at her
lover on that cruel wedding day when she had turned
away from the altar, a bride without a bridegroom,
a stricken creature who in her wrath hated the whole
world, and felt revengeful enough to have plunged a
knife into the heart of the man who had disappointed
her and made her the sensation of an hour.</p>

<p>He glossed that fact over very lightly by saying:</p>

<p>“Miss Ellyson was naturally cruelly wounded, believing
herself a jilted bride.”</p>

<p>“My proud, beautiful Cora, it was indeed a most
cruel ordeal, and I would have died to spare her such
pain. Are you quite sure she understands everything
now, Noel?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[94]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; I went and told her myself how everything
fell out, and it was fully explained in the newspapers
of the next day&mdash;so every one knows now that it was
an untoward accident that prevented the wedding, and
that it will take place as soon as you are recovered.”</p>

<p>“And Cora exonerates me from blame?”</p>

<p>“Ye-es,” hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“You are keeping back something, Noel? Speak
out.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, she was rather vexed over your attending
Miss Dalrymple’s funeral. You see, Laurier,
it was that which really caused our deuced hurry, that
upset everything.”</p>

<p>“I never intended Cora should know I went to that
funeral.”</p>

<p>“You may be sure I did not tell her, for I thought
strange of your doing it myself, but some dunce saw
you there, blurted it out to Van Dorn, and he told
Miss Ellyson. See?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” and for a few moments Laurier remained
silent, his thoughts divided between the dead
girl and the living one&mdash;the one he had wounded unto
death, the one who was to be his bride.</p>

<p>He gave a long, long sigh to Jessie’s memory, then
a chivalrous thought to Cora.</p>

<p>“Poor girl, how cruelly she must have suffered in
the terrible suspense of that hour. I must make it up
to her, Noel, as soon as I can. Perhaps it would please
her to be married now before I get well.”</p>

<p>“Now? Here?”&mdash;in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes; why not? Loving each other so well, what
does the time and place matter if it is a true union of<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
hearts? It would stop silly gossip over the interrupted
wedding, and such a proof of my tenderness
would perhaps condone my offense in showing respect
to Mrs. Dalrymple by attending her daughter’s
obsequies.”</p>

<p>There was a slight touch of bitterness in the last
words that Noel did not understand, and he said, in
his brusque way:</p>

<p>“Not many girls would care to be married by a sick
bed and sacrifice all the fol-lalas of a brilliant wedding.”</p>

<p>“But Cora would because she loves me very fondly.
Will you go and see her for me, Noel, and ask her if
she would be willing to marry me to-morrow, so that
we can start on our wedding tour as soon as I am well
enough?”</p>

<p>Noel went, and the patient, tired by his long talk,
dozed again, and filled up the interval of time this
way till his friend’s return.</p>

<p>He wakened at last with a start at a light touch on
his arm.</p>

<p>“Ah, Noel, is that you? Where have you been so
long? Ah, I remember now! You saw Cora? She
will grant my wish?”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken, old boy. She&mdash;refuses!”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE NEW WINE OF LOVE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Cora Ellyson had, indeed, refused her lover’s request.</p>

<p>Ernest Noel had gauged her quite correctly in asserting
that she would be unwilling to be married simply,
without the pomp and ceremony so dear to the feminine
mind.</p>

<p>And, besides, though pained over her lover’s accident,
she could not forgive in her heart the first cause
of it.</p>

<p>She argued to herself that if he had not gone to
the funeral he would not have been forced to the haste
that had resulted so disastrously to himself and caused
her so cruel a mortification.</p>

<p>“Whoever heard of anything so outré as a man’s
going to a funeral in his wedding suit, and on the eve
of his marriage?”</p>

<p>She cried to herself in a passion of jealous anger,
hating poor Jessie for the sympathy he had shown and
the few thoughts she had taken from the proud bride
who had claimed all.</p>

<p>Despite her love for him, Cora longed to punish her
lover for his fealty to Jessie’s memory.</p>

<p>She did not consider that he had already suffered
enough. She desired his punishment to come through
her, the chosen of his heart.</p>

<p>If any one had told her that the fire of his love that
had burned so fiercely until that day in the park had<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
cooled down into an indifference that he would not
own even to his own heart, she could not have believed
it.</p>

<p>They had had their lovers’ quarrels before, flirted
with others before, kissed and made up always. She
expected things to go as usual.</p>

<p>She had not punished him enough yet, and the refusal
to marry him on his sick bed was a stroke that
secretly pleased her very much. It would cause him
such cruel pain he would realize her value more.</p>

<p>She even declined to visit him while he lay ill at the
hospital on the plea that her nerves could not bear the
shock.</p>

<p>“Tell him to get well as soon as possible, so that my
wedding gown will not get out of fashion,” was the
gay message sent by Mrs. van Dorn, who with Mrs.
Dalrymple went to call on the invalid.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the sight of the bereaved mother
in her deep mourning that put the thought of Jessie
in his mind&mdash;perhaps she had never been out of it since
that tragic night. Anyhow, he received Cora’s messages
with apparent resignation, and in the long days
of convalescence, while she thought he was yearning
for her with ceaseless impatience, his thoughts kept
wandering to the dead girl, living over in memory their
brief acquaintance&mdash;the first time he had seen her
and been startled by her naïve, girlish beauty, the
struggle with Doyle when he had rescued her from
the villain’s rude advances, the drive to the park, and&mdash;the
fatal kiss!</p>

<p>Whenever Laurier recalled that sweet, clinging kiss
he had taken from Jessie’s red, flowerlike lips, his heart<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
would beat wildly in his breast, and the warm color
flush up to his brow.</p>

<p>The garbled story of a glass of wine too much that
he had told to Jessie in excusing himself, was quite untrue.
He had not taken any wine; it was a bewildering
flash-up of emotion that had throbbed at his heart
and made him yield to the temptation to press her
sweet lips with his own.</p>

<p>It was true that the influence of Cora still remained
so strong that he had soon turned from the girl to
watch the passing throngs for his old love that he
might note the jealous flash of her great eyes at sight
of an apparent rival&mdash;afterward when suffering from
the effects of his accident in the park, and exposed to
the tender witcheries of Cora, it had been easy to
win him back.</p>

<p>But the events of that night, when Jessie had come
to Mrs. Dalrymple’s&mdash;her love, her humiliation, her
despair, coupled with Cora’s heartless behavior, were
impressed ineffaceably on his heart. The one had inspired
pity and sympathy, the other deep disgust.</p>

<p>“Pity is akin to love,” and now that Jessie was dead
Laurier knew that, had she lived, he could have loved
her as well&mdash;aye, better&mdash;than he had ever loved
proud, jealous Cora, who looked on him as a sort of
slave to her caprices, to be scolded and sent away, then
whistled back at will.</p>

<p>Had Jessie lived, he would have bidden this tenderness
back, knowing that his fealty belonged to his betrothed,
but it did not matter now if he gave Jessie
some tender regrets in the few days that must elapse<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
before he married Cora and pledged to her irrevocably
the devotion of his heart.</p>

<p>In the meantime, new influences were at work to
sunder more widely the two hearts already chilled by
jealousy and anger.</p>

<p>Ernest Noel, having always admired beautiful Cora
at a distance, was now brought into more intimate relations
with her by the errand on which he had gone
for Laurier, and the young girl, not averse to a little
flirtation to relieve the tedium of waiting her lover’s
recovery, smilingly encouraged his frank advances.</p>

<p>It became the customary thing to call every evening
and report Laurier’s progress on the road to recovery
to his fair betrothed.</p>

<p>No secret was made of these calls to Laurier, who
each morning received an enthusiastic description of
how Cora had looked and acted and the flippant messages
she had sent her lover.</p>

<p>Believing that she was arousing Laurier’s jealousy,
as she had often done before, and thus increasing the
fervor of his love, she rested secure, though secretly
burning with anxiety to see him again, and only deterred
from a visit to him by the rooted determination
to pay him out for his fault, as she called it, to
herself.</p>

<p>Beautiful, vindictive, jealous, she was capable of
savage fury when aroused, but in indulging her fierce
resentment she was running a risk she little dreamed.</p>

<p>Laurier, getting an insight into the flirtation, did not
feel the least disturbed, but was startled at himself
when he detected a latent wish that she would transfer
her affections to Noel.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">WOULD THE OLD LOVE RETURN?</span></h2>
</div>


<p>December snows lay deep upon the ground when
Laurier left the hospital two weeks after the fateful
accident that had postponed his wedding.</p>

<p>His first visit was to Cora.</p>

<p>Having punished him as she deemed sufficiently, she
was passionately glad to see him again.</p>

<p>The fond arms twined about his neck, the dark
head nestled against his breast, the dewy red lips were
upturned to meet his own, but as he pressed them he
remembered other lips, oh, so warm and sweet and
clinging, now pale and cold in death.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">Ah, pale, pale, now those rosy lips
</div><div class="indent0">That once I kissed so fondly,
</div><div class="indent0">And closed for aye the sparkling glance
</div><div class="indent0">That dwelt on me so kindly.
</div><div class="indent0">And moldering now in silent dust
</div><div class="indent0">The heart that loved me dearly,
</div><div class="indent0">But still within my bosom’s care
</div><div class="indent0">Shall live my Highland Mary!
</div></div></div></div>

<p>Was it Laurier’s punishment for his sin that Jessie
should haunt him so, that her pale wraith should glide
between him and his living love, and make his lips cold
to her kiss and his heart chill to her tender embrace!</p>

<p>Time was when his blood had run like fire with
those arms about his neck, and that dark head on his
breast, but how strangely all was altered now, and
what a deep depression hung over him, though he
tried to hide it from those searching, dark eyes, and to
outdo her in the warmth of his greeting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[101]</span></p>

<p>“Dear Frank, how pale and ill you look! And&mdash;and&mdash;you
do not kiss me as of old. Are you vexed
with me because I would not consent to a sick-bed
wedding?” archly.</p>

<p>“No, no, dear; why should I be? It was better to
wait and have a public wedding so as to display your
lovely bridal gown, of course,” he answered, forcing
a smile.</p>

<p>“And you were not impatient?”</p>

<p>“I was too ill for that, you know.”</p>

<p>“Poor Frank! How you must have suffered! I
hope you were not vexed that I did not come to see
you. But they told me you were looking so frightfully
ill I had not the heart lest I should scold you, for,
after all, everything was your own fault, you know,
going to that girl’s funeral.”</p>

<p>“Do not let us bring that subject up again, Cora.
I only did what I thought was my duty.”</p>

<p>“Duty! That kept you from your own wedding!”
she cried reproachfully. “Only for that we should be
married now.”</p>

<p>“We can be married to-morrow if you are willing,
Cora.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! How could we? All the arrangements
will have to be made over again. And my maid of
honor is out of town&mdash;gone South for a month.”</p>

<p>“You can choose another!”</p>

<p>“But she made me promise to wait her return!”</p>

<p>“I do not think that is at all necessary. Choose
some other girl and let us have the agony over!” abstractedly.</p>

<p>“The agony! Sir?” and Cora Ellyson almost transfixed<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
him with the indignant flash of her great, dark
eyes.</p>

<p>He started, realizing he had made a blunder.</p>

<p>“Dear Cora, I beg your pardon, I did not mean to
wound you. Do you not understand my impatient
mood? That it is agony to me, this waiting to call you
mine,” anxiously.</p>

<p>“Dear Frank, was that what you meant? I thought
for a moment that&mdash;that&mdash;but, no, it would be impossible
you should look on our marriage as a bore!”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” he echoed fervently, but in the bottom
of his heart he was terribly distressed at his own
indifference, he who had once loved Cora to madness.</p>

<p>He would not have had her find out the cruel truth
for the world. He played his part as a true lover
still with amiable deceit, thinking anxiously:</p>

<p>“This is but a caprice of illness. Love will come
back.”</p>

<p>Alas!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<p>Cora was charmed with the belief in his anxiety
for the wedding. She thought that absence had, indeed,
taught him her value. With pretty coquetry she pretended
coyness in naming another wedding day just
to make him plead for haste.</p>

<p>Understanding what was expected of him, he continued
to insist, until she named a day just two weeks
distant.</p>

<p>“And it shall be a home wedding this time. I could<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
not bear to go to church again after&mdash;that day! Oh,
I knew it was ill-fated when we met that horrible
funeral! I wish I had turned back then and so escaped
the next cruel hour&mdash;the waiting, the anxiety, the curious
faces, some sympathetic, some sarcastic&mdash;the sinking
at the heart, the bitter resentment, believing myself
jilted at the altar! Ah, Frank, there are times
when I feel as if I can never forgive you for the
humiliation of that hour!” cried Cora, in passionate
excitement.</p>

<p>He took her burning hands and kissed them fondly,
crying:</p>

<p>“I will make it all up to you, my darling, when I
am your husband, by the most patient devotion!”</p>

<p>And as he gazed at the dark, brilliant face that had
once charmed him so, he told himself that surely the
old love would come back as soon as that painful, lingering
remorse over Jessie should fade from his mind.</p>

<p>Who could help loving beautiful Cora, even in spite
of the glimpses he had had of cruel depths in her
mind? He would try to forget how heartlessly she
had acted to her hapless little rival and love her again
in spite of all.</p>

<p>He knew that scores of men envied him the prize
he had won in the promise of her hand; even Ernest
Noel, his best man, scarcely disguised the fact that he
had fallen a victim to her witcheries, and frankly
envied his friend, so he was not surprised on going
out to meet Noel coming up the steps to call on Cora,
as had now become his daily habit.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">PLAYING WITH FIRE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The young men nodded gayly at each other, then
Ernest Noel passed into the house.</p>

<p>“How radiant you look, ma belle!” he exclaimed
enviously.</p>

<p>Cora’s red lips parted over her pearly teeth in an
enchanting smile of joy, as she answered:</p>

<p>“Frank has just gone, and we were naming the
wedding day again.”</p>

<p>She knew well that the announcement would pierce
his heart like a sword, for only yesterday Ernest had
proved unfaithful to his friend and pleaded for her
love.</p>

<p>Beautiful Cora had laughed at her passionate suitor,
enraging him with her scorn.</p>

<p>“You led me on, encouraged me to love you, and
hope for a return!” he cried sullenly.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! You knew I was engaged to Frank all
the time!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Yet you pretend indifference to him, refused to
marry him on what might have been his deathbed, and,
besides, I had heard it whispered that you were so
angry on your wedding day you had vowed vengeance
on your recreant bridegroom. Is not all this
true, Cora?”</p>

<p>“I deny your right to question me. I shall marry
Frank when he gets well,” she cried, with her most
imperious air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[105]</span></p>

<p>“My God, then you were only coquetting with me
to pass the time&mdash;is it true?”</p>

<p>“I was kind to you because you were Frank’s friend&mdash;that
is all&mdash;and you are very wicked to try to steal
me from him,” she cried defiantly.</p>

<p>“You were playing with fire,” he muttered, and
turned and went away with a strange smile glooming
his dark, strong face.</p>

<p>To-day he wore a careless smile, and did not flinch
when she told him so triumphantly that she had just
named the wedding day again.</p>

<p>“Is it so, indeed? Then you will soon be lost to me
forever!” he cried lightly, adding: “I must steal every
hour I can from my fortunate rival until the fatal day.
The crust of the snow is hard, and my sleigh is at the
door. Will you come with me for a ride?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will go,” she answered kindly.</p>

<p>Warmly wrapped in sealskin, she followed him out
to the natty little sleigh, careless in her happiness of
the gloomy day and lowering storm clouds, little
dreaming of what was coming.</p>

<p>He tucked the warm robes cozily about her, took
up the reins, and they set off at a spanking pace, gliding
gayly over the smooth crust of snow until they
found themselves leaving the crowded city behind.</p>

<p>They had talked but little, but now Noel slackened
rein, and said suddenly:</p>

<p>“So you really love Laurier after all?”</p>

<p>“Of course&mdash;when I am to marry him in two
weeks!”</p>

<p>“Yet a week ago I could have sworn that you did
not care for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[106]</span></p>

<p>“Appearances are deceitful.”</p>

<p>“Yes, very,” he replied, with a low, bitter laugh,
adding: “For I could almost have sworn that your
heart had turned from him to me!”</p>

<p>“What egregious vanity!” cried Cora, laughing outright.</p>

<p>The laugh almost drove him mad. Striking the
black, fiery horse lightly with the whip so that it
dashed quickly forward again, he almost hissed:</p>

<p>“What would you do to any one who should come
between you and Laurier?”</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes flashed, she ground her white teeth
together viciously, crying:</p>

<p>“I should hate them, I should want to murder them!”</p>

<p>Noel’s face grew livid, but he looked around at her
fixedly, crying:</p>

<p>“Then you will want to murder me, for I am a barrier
between you and Laurier that cannot be removed.
I am your lawful husband, beautiful Cora!”</p>

<p>“You are mad!” she cried, in alarm. “Let us turn
back instantly. See, the snow is beginning to fall!”</p>

<p>Without heeding her command, Ernest Noel drove
on through the gathering storm, replying hoarsely:</p>

<p>“I am not mad, Cora, I am telling you the truth.
Do you remember the private theatricals we took part
in last week for the benefit of that little church? You
were the bride, I was the bridegroom, and it was a
lawful marriage, for I made private arrangements to
have it so, securing a license and a minister. You
are my wife as fast as the law can make you. Now,
what have you to say?”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A DESPERATE DEED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Cora Ellyson sat speechless by the side of Ernest
Noel for several minutes as the sleigh rushed on
through the whirling snowflakes.</p>

<p>Her face was as white as the snowflakes, her very
lips pale, and her eyes flashed with a dangerous anger
that startled her desperate lover. In their dark gleam
he read, indeed, a murderous hate too deep for words&mdash;a
hate that could kill, so great was its fury. Choking
with grief and rage, she remained speechless,
though her writhing lips struggled for words. A despair
too deep for utterance possessed her soul.</p>

<p>What, wedded to this villain! Tricked into a ceremony
that bound her to him and cut her off from
Frank, her beloved, forever! It was too horrible!
She could not believe it!</p>

<p>“Is it really true? You have not lied to me?” gaspingly.</p>

<p>“It is true as Heaven, Cora. Say what you will,
you are my wife, and as such I claim you! Come, give
me a kiss, and let us make up our quarrel!”</p>

<p>Throwing his arm around her waist he drew her
forcibly to his side, pressing hot kisses on the shrinking
face, while her shrieks rang wildly on the air&mdash;wildly,
but unheeded, for they were in the country
now on a lonely, unfrequented road, and the darkness
of the wintry afternoon, together with the whirling
snowflakes, made everything dim and indistinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[108]</span></p>

<p>A very frenzy of rage possessed the wretched girl.
She had said rightly that she could murder any one
who came between her and Laurier.</p>

<p>As she struggled wildly with Noel, she flung one
hand up to her hair, whose dark, silken braids were
pierced through with a strong but slender silver dagger
with a jeweled hilt. Withdrawing it dexterously,
she made a lunge at his breast.</p>

<p>With a stifled oath he warded off the first blow,
catching the point of the dagger in his own hand so
that it pierced through, the blood spouting out in a
fountain of crimson, but, withdrawing it quickly, she
aimed again for his heart.</p>

<p>“My God!” shrilled in agony from his lips as his
arm fell, and the reins dropped from his hands while
he sank an inert mass at the bottom of the sleigh. The
next moment the black horse, frightened by her
shrieks, had the bit between his teeth and was running
away, while Cora, crouched in the seat wild-eyed,
pale-faced, an image of horror, resigned herself to inevitable
death.</p>

<p>On over the frozen snow, through the whirling
storm, he ran for over a mile, then&mdash;stumbling over
some obstruction in the road, he came to a sudden stop,
and the little sleigh overturned, throwing its occupants
out into the drifted snow.</p>

<p>One breathless moment and Cora scrambled to her
feet unhurt, but not so the companion of her wild
drive.</p>

<p>Silent and pallid, a senseless heap with the blood
staining his white shirt bosom and his wounded hand,
Ernest Noel lay like one dead in the snow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[109]</span></p>

<p>“I have killed him!” the girl muttered wildly, but
so terrible was her resentment that she felt no remorse
for her deed, only a fierce joy that he was out of her
way.</p>

<p>“He deserved it all!” she muttered, casting her
glance hurriedly around to see if there was any witness
to her crime.</p>

<p>But she was all alone with nature&mdash;nature in her
stormiest mood, the wind shrieking in a rising gale,
blowing the snow across the fields, bending and twisting
the bare boughs of the trees, while the drifts were
piled high against the rough stones of an old lime
quarry close to the side of the road.</p>

<p>In that lonely scene the desperate girl stood wild-eyed,
breathless, still burning with rage that precluded
all remorse.</p>

<p>“If I could only hide him, if only the snowdrifts
would cover him from my sight forever!” she exclaimed,
and then her glance fell on the old quarry and
lighted with intelligence.</p>

<p>“I can throw him down there!” she muttered, and
with a strength born of terror, dragged the inert body
by the arms, and pushed it down into the pit.</p>

<p>It fell with a hollow thud that made the panting
girl, listening above, shudder violently, and fly back
to the sleigh.</p>

<p>The black horse, seemingly subdued by its wild race
and with the sweat streaming from every pore, despite
the biting wind, stood patiently waiting her
pleasure as she nervously returned and caught up the
reins preparing for the inclement drive home.</p>

<p>A voice struck on her ears, sending terror to her<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
heart lest the dead had arisen from his grave in the
deserted pit.</p>

<p>“I’ll drive you home, Miss Ellyson!”</p>

<p>Who was this, calling her boldly by name? With a
start of terror, she lifted her eyes, and saw a man
striding to her through the snow.</p>

<p>She had seen the bold eyes, the coarse, good-looking
face before. It was Carey Doyle.</p>

<p>“How came you here?” she faltered fearfully, and
he answered coolly:</p>

<p>“I was cutting across fields visiting some country
friends of mine when I saw you upset, and hastened
to your assistance. Who was the man you pushed
over into the pit, Miss Ellyson? Surely not Frank
Laurier?”</p>

<p>Her heart sank with wild alarm as she answered
faintly:</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you&mdash;are mistaken. I&mdash;I&mdash;came&mdash;here
alone, I swear. I was only&mdash;only&mdash;looking down into
the pit thinking how terrible if the sleigh had overset
down there!”</p>

<p>“Miss Ellyson, I saw you dragging the man over
there by his arms&mdash;don’t deny it,” Doyle returned
masterfully.</p>

<p>She was detected, she realized it, and began to sob
hysterically:</p>

<p>“Oh, for sweet pity’s sake do not betray me! He&mdash;he&mdash;was
killed when the sleigh upset&mdash;and I&mdash;I&mdash;did
not know what to do! I thought I would leave him
there. How could I drive home with a dead man!”
shudderingly.</p>

<p>“What was his name?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[111]</span></p>

<p>“I will not tell you!” wildly.</p>

<p>“Miss Ellyson, there is blood on your hands and
your dress. Is it possible you have done murder?”
Carey Doyle demanded, with sudden sternness.</p>

<p>“No, no, it was an accident! He&mdash;he&mdash;would have
mistreated me, and I&mdash;I&mdash;defended myself with the
hairpin! It wounded him, and then the fall killed
him! I&mdash;I&mdash;oh, sir, I cannot bear the sensation of
discovery. I will make you rich if you will keep this
terrible secret!” pleaded Cora, kneeling down abjectly
in the snow before the exultant wretch glorying in the
discovery he had made.</p>

<p>Rather than put herself in the power of this bad man
Cora had better have put the dead man back into the
sleigh and driven back to the city with a full confession
of her sin. Surely no jury would have convicted
her of murder when they heard how she had been
goaded by cruel wrong into a terrible deed. They
would all agree that she had been driven temporarily
insane by her fear and suffering.</p>

<p>But her poor brain was too distraught to think
clearly. A horrible fear possessed her lest the deed
become known, and she should fall into the hands of
the law.</p>

<p>She knelt down in the cold snow with the biting
wind cutting her white face and blowing her dark,
loosened hair about her, her small hands clasped, pleading,
praying:</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, do not betray me! I could not bear detection!
What will you take to keep my wretched secret?”</p>

<p>His eyes gleamed with cupidity as he answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[112]</span></p>

<p>“You are rich, so I don’t think you would mind
a thousand dollars, would you?”</p>

<p>“You shall have it!”</p>

<p>“Then my lips are sealed. Get in and let me drive
you home, Miss Ellyson. Then I must manage to have
the horse and sleigh returned to the stables without
exciting suspicion, so you will have to confide in me,
don’t you see, so that I can help you better,” shrewdly.</p>

<p>Oh, how it galled her pride to take him into her
confidence, but there was no other way, so she said
evasively:</p>

<p>“He was Ernest Noel, who fell in love with me
and tried to supplant Mr. Laurier in my heart. On
this drive he took the liberty of kissing me, and in defending
myself I gave him a fatal blow.”</p>

<p>He helped her in and took her home, afterward returning
the sleigh to the stables in a way that diverted
all suspicion.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Two weeks rolled around very quickly and brought
Cora’s wedding day again.</p>

<p>It would be somewhat different from the one that
had been so tragically interrupted the month before.</p>

<p>This would be a home wedding at Mrs. van Dorn’s,
where Cora was still staying.</p>

<p>And she had chosen another maid of honor, because
the first one was still absent in the South.</p>

<p>Laurier also would have to select another friend
for his best man, as Ernest Noel had mysteriously disappeared.</p>

<p>No one had seen him since the afternoon when he
had taken Miss Ellyson sleigh riding, and it was currently
believed that the young man had committed
suicide.</p>

<p>Cora had lent color to this report by frankly owning
that Noel had perfidiously sought to win her from
Laurier, and in the madness of disappointment threatened
to take his own life.</p>

<p>She told glibly of their long sleigh ride, in which
they had been caught in the snowstorm and lost their
way, not returning until after nightfall.</p>

<p>She grew pale and grave when she told how Noel
had pleaded for her love in passionate phrases, and
how angry he had grown when she had upbraided him
for his treachery to his friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[114]</span></p>

<p>“All is fair in love or war,” he had replied doggedly,
and turned a deaf ear to her pleadings that he would
turn back from the storm that was gathering.</p>

<p>“I shall drive on and on if it be to perdition until
you take pity on me!” he had vowed grimly, but her
fright and tears had moved him at last to bring her
back home.</p>

<p>With her hand close clasped in Laurier’s, Cora had
repeated her story, ending sadly:</p>

<p>“I was very angry with the poor fellow, yet I pitied
him, too; he was so tragically in earnest, and I shall
never forget him as I saw him last when he left me
at the door. His face was pale as death, and his eyes
glared wildly under the electric lights as he took my
hand in his and kissed it, murmuring tragically:</p>

<p>“You will never see me again, for I cannot bear my
life without your love! I shall end it to-night, and
when you hear of my death you will know I did it for
your sake, and may the thought of it prove a thorn in
the roses of your happiness!”</p>

<p>Cora’s voice sank to a low, sobbing cadence as she
added:</p>

<p>“He looked wild enough to do any rash deed, but I
did not believe him, I thought he was only trying to
frighten me. I said good night quickly, and ran into
the house, for I was almost frozen, and scared half to
death from our interview.”</p>

<p>“Poor Cora&mdash;poor Noel! It was very distressing to
you both, I know, and I fear he really carried out his
threat, for nothing has been heard of him yet, and his
relatives are getting very anxious,” said Laurier<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
gravely, almost wishing in his heart that Cora had
taken pity on Noel’s love and accepted him.</p>

<p>He knew well that she had coquetted with the young
man and led him on to his madness&mdash;he had seen it
all along while he lay ill&mdash;but it was useless to tax
her with the wrong, he could only think bitterly:</p>

<p>“Why will women break hearts for pastime?”</p>

<p>But following the thought, a pale, reproachful face
seemed to rise before him, and lips that he had kissed
for the whim of a moment&mdash;red, rosy lips&mdash;seemed
to murmur:</p>

<p>“What of men?”</p>

<p>So he could not reproach Cora; he was not without
fault himself.</p>

<p>The days passed quickly with no tidings of Noel,
and the twenty-second of December came&mdash;his wedding
day!</p>

<p>Oh, with what joy he had looked forward to it once!
The day that should give him proud, beautiful Cora
for his own!</p>

<p>He had loved her madly for a little while, but all his
efforts could not bring back the passion now. It was
cold and dead, and his heart lay like a stone in his
breast.</p>

<p>They had decided to go South on a bridal tour, both
having crossed the ocean several times, so that there
would have been no novelty in the trip. Everything
was in readiness for the journey as soon as the wedding
reception was over.</p>

<p>Why was it that he could look forward so indifferently
to the tête-à-tête journey with the stately bride
for whose sake he was bitterly envied by other men?<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
Did a dead hand, small and white and warning&mdash;rise
between him and his bride, barring out happiness?</p>

<p>It almost seemed so.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">Would to God I could awaken!
</div><div class="indent1">For I dream I know not how,
</div><div class="indent0">And my soul is sorely shaken
</div><div class="indent0">Lest an evil step be taken,
</div><div class="indent0">Lest the dead who is forsaken
</div><div class="indent1">May not be happy now.
</div></div></div></div>

<p>He would not listen to the haunting voices throbbing
at his heart, but, putting them aside, prepared to
keep his troth plight, praying yet for love to come back
to its forsaken nest in his heart.</p>

<p>Not so with beautiful Cora, who, beaming with
joyous anticipations, was making ready for her bridal,
smiling as the maid pinned on the bridal veil, thinking
there could be no bar to her happiness now, for was
not Frank waiting for her downstairs, and everything
in readiness!</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Cora, how magnificent you look! May I
let them all see you now?” cried the exultant maid.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am ready to go downstairs now, and it is
time, is it not?” tilting back the long pier glass for
another admiring view at herself in the glory of her
white brocade train and point-lace veil.</p>

<p>Fifine stepped to the door and called Mrs. van Dorn
and the others who were waiting, but as they crossed
the threshold, loud, piercing shrieks rang through the
room, and a horrible sight met their eyes.</p>

<p>In stepping back for a better view of herself, Cora
had thoughtlessly brushed against a cluster of wax
lights burning in a silver candelabra on her dressing<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
table. In an instant the flames caught the filmy folds
of her veil and ignited it, wrapping her quickly in leaping
flames like so many writhing serpents.</p>

<p>Never had there been a more tragic interruption
to a wedding.</p>

<p>The splendid mansion so gayly decorated for the
occasion, instantly became a scene of dismay and confusion.</p>

<p>The shrieks of the frightened women upstairs
brought the bridegroom and guests rushing to their
aid, and it was Frank Laurier himself who first had
the presence of mind to tear the burning garments
from Cora, though at the cost of painful injuries to
himself.</p>

<p>But he scarcely gave a thought to that, so keen was
his pity for the poor wreck of what had been but five
minutes ago a beautiful, radiant young girl, with her
heart full of love and pride going to the altar with
her handsome lover.</p>

<p>Cora’s injuries were so severe that her blackened,
swollen features were quite unrecognizable. The
bridal gown was reduced to a charred, black mass, and
there was not a vestige left of the costly point-lace
veil.</p>

<p>For long weeks she hovered between life and death,
and no one supposed she could ever recover. Indeed,
her best friends thought it might be better to die than
to live with all her radiant beauty gone. All her beautiful
hair, her eyebrows and lashes were burned away,
and her once lovely skin was scarred and red. The
great, flashing, dark eyes were dim and sunken.</p>

<p>When after long weeks she began to convalesce to<span class="pagenum">[118]</span>
the surprise of all her doctors, people said that she
ought to release Frank Laurier from his engagement.
No man would be willing to marry such a fright.</p>

<p>But Cora was not so magnanimous. She sent word
to her lover to be true to her, and she would marry
him as soon as she was quite well again.</p>

<p>Then she consulted the most eminent physicians and
dermatologists in the city about the restoration of her
beauty.</p>

<p>She was wild with anguish over her disfigurements,
and declared that she would sacrifice her whole fortune
to regain what she had lost by the terrible accident.</p>

<p>She put herself in their hands and they promised
to do their best, but the process would be slow&mdash;she
must give up the world for a year, perhaps, ere success
could crown their efforts. She agreed to this and
refused to see her lover until her lost beauty should
be restored.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“LOVE, I WILL LOVE YOU EVER!”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Among the passengers on a steamer homeward
bound from England to America were a man and his
daughter who attracted much admiring attention from
all the other passengers.</p>

<p>The man was Leon Lyndon, and he was returning
with his daughter Jessie after nearly two years’ absence
from New York. Lyndon, tall, fair, middle-aged,
with a most serious expression, did not cultivate
acquaintances, but rather repelled advances, preferring
to devote himself to his beautiful daughter, who in
turn gave him all her attention.</p>

<p>It was most provoking to all the young men, who
were simply wild to know the dainty beauty, and to
tempt her to flirtations on the deck these balmy September
evenings when the sea shone like silver and the
full moon rode in gleaming majesty through the pathless
blue sky.</p>

<p>It was too bad, they said, for her father to monopolize
her always, hanging around her chair with books
that they read together all day, and in the evenings
strumming on his mandolin while she warbled tender
love songs in a voice so sweet that the very winds and
waves seemed to hush themselves to listen.</p>

<p>Curiosity was rife concerning the attractive pair,
but no one could satisfy it, and when they had been
three days out no one had secured anything but a bowing
acquaintance with either.</p>

<p>It was about this time that a young man who had<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
been confined to his stateroom all these days by sea-sickness
now made his appearance on deck.</p>

<p>It was no less a person than Frank Laurier, who
had been abroad almost a year, and was returning at
the summons of his betrothed.</p>

<p>It was almost two years since Cora’s terrible accident
had so abruptly interrupted their wedding, and
never, since the first hour, had he been permitted to
gaze on her face.</p>

<p>The restoration of her health and beauty had consumed
many months, and though he had entreated to
see her, the request had always been sorrowfully
denied.</p>

<p>Cora’s heart ached for the sight of his face and the
touch of his hand, but she dared not risk the shock he
must have experienced at sight of her poor, marred
face. Still believing in his love that had ceased to
exist, she feared his disenchantment.</p>

<p>Afraid of the weakness of her own will, anxious
to place herself out of temptation, she entreated him
to go abroad while she was in the hands of the doctors,
to remain until she summoned him with the glad
news that they might meet again to part no more forever.</p>

<p>He had been absent almost a year now, and they
had corresponded in a desultory fashion, when suddenly
he received the letter of recall, telling him she
was well and beautiful again, and he must return, because
her heart was breaking to see him once more.</p>

<p>Laurier’s heart was touched by her faithful love,
and he reproached himself for the way he had neglected
her letters, often not answering them for weeks,<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
almost forgetting her existence in the indifference that
had stolen over him and made him wish in secret that
something would happen to break the irksome bond
that fettered his changed heart.</p>

<p>Many a man would not have hesitated to own that
he had ceased to love, and claimed his freedom from
her hands, but not so Laurier, who prided himself on
his honor, and pitied Cora too sincerely to wound her
loving heart.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">Doubt’s cruel whisper shall not break the spell,
</div><div class="indent1">Oh, thou whom to deceive is to befriend;

</div></div></div></div>

<p>He was going home to marry her and make her as
happy as he could. For himself it did not matter
greatly. Even if his heart was cold to her, she had
at least no living rival, and that must suffice.</p>

<p>That evening when he came on deck&mdash;the young
men had persuaded him&mdash;begging him to come and
listen to the sweet voice singing in the moonlight, the
voice of a girl as lovely as an angel, but with such a
selfish, cruel papa that he would not permit any of
them to approach within arm’s length.</p>

<p>“I wish you would storm the citadel of her heart,
Laurier, and avenge us!” laughed one.</p>

<p>“You forget that I am going home to be married!”
he replied gravely.</p>

<p>“Oh, a little flirtation beforehand need not matter.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon. A young girl’s love is too
sacred to be trifled with. I will go on deck and listen
because I adore singing, but I shall not try to make the
young lady’s acquaintance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[122]</span></p>

<p>So in the silvery moonlight of that balmy September
evening he went on deck with his friends, and
saw, sitting apart, the man lightly touching the strings
of a mandolin, while by his side stood his daughter, a
slender, classically gowned girl in a simple robe of
warm, white cashmere falling in straight folds, her
pure, lovely face crowned with golden hair, lifted to
the sky while she sang in notes of liquid melody:</p>

</div></div></div></div>

<p>Frank Laurier stood apart, looking and listening
spellbound, while something sweet and tender to the
verge of pain stabbed his heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[123]</span></p>

<p>What was there in the pure, uplifted face and in
the sweet, sad voice that seemed to strike a mournful
chord in memory like some familiar strain? He had
never heard the song before, and surely never seen the
exquisite face, else it had never been forgotten.</p>

<p>He said to himself that she had only made him think
of love again&mdash;love that had grown a stranger to his
heart, though once as sweet and welcome as the song
she sang.</p>

<p>She rested a few moments, without observing her
rapt listeners, then the sweet voice rose again, following
the chords of the mandolin:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div><div class="indent1">The mists rose dull and gray,
</div><div class="indent0">And in their ears, like a mocking voice,

</div></div></div></div>

<p>The sweet voice was inexpressibly pathetic. Laurier
felt a lump rise in his throat and a moisture in his
eyes. He longed to clasp the singer in his arms and
soothe her tender grief.</p>

</div>


<p>The sweet voice died away in lingering echoes over
the waters, the mandolin ceased its plaintive chords,
and Jessie sat down with a low sigh by her father’s
side, and leaned her head against his shoulder in pathetic
silence, while the listeners stole away, leaving
Laurier alone in the seat he had taken, gazing absently
over the moonlit waters while ocean’s tone
seemed to echo over and over:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">“Love, I will love you ever,
</div><div class="indent0">Love, I will leave you never!”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>He had sat down very suddenly because he had
staggered from emotion over a shock.</p>

<p>It had come to him all at once why the girl’s face
and voice had seemed so familiar that it had awakened
subtle pain blent with keenest pleasure.</p>

<p>The fair, exquisite face was like one that had been
lying long beneath the coffinlid, the voice was one
whose sweet, reproachful tones had once pierced his
heart like an avenging sword. She brought back to
him the irrevocable past.</p>

<p>“So like, so like, she might be Jessie Lyndon’s sister,”
he mused. “But no, that could not be. Mrs.
Dalrymple had but one daughter. It is only a chance
likeness.”</p>

<p>He began to wonder what their names could be, the
father and daughter, and when one of his friends came
back to his side he whispered the question:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[126]</span></p>

<p>“What did you say their names were?”</p>

<p>He was astounded when the young man answered
calmly:</p>

<p>“His name is Lyndon, and he calls his daughter
Jessie.”</p>

<p>“Heavens!” and Laurier started violently.</p>

<p>“What is it?” cried his friend.</p>

<p>“Nothing! Yes, that wretched sickness is coming
on again. Will you assist me to my stateroom?”</p>

<p>He lay wakeful and wretched all night, tortured by
a name and a semblance, thinking that surely she must
have been related to the dead girl by some close tie,
and wishing to know her just for the sake of the past.</p>

<p>The next morning, in spite of his bad night, he was
on deck early, determined, if possible, to make the
acquaintance of the new Jessie Lyndon.</p>

<p>But our heroine had not been on shipboard three
days without finding out the name of this important
fellow passenger.</p>

<p>Her father had discovered it early and communicated
it briefly, saying:</p>

<p>“Do not recognize him when he comes on deck. If
he addresses you, pretend perfect forgetfulness of him
and the past.”</p>

<p>“You may be sure I will do so,” with a lightning
gleam of pride in the soft, dark eyes, and a swift rush
of color to the round cheek.</p>

<p>But a moment later she asked, almost inaudibly:</p>

<p>“His wife&mdash;does she accompany him?”</p>

<p>“No, he is alone.”</p>

<p>When Laurier saw her in the broad glare of daylight
he perceived that her likeness to the dead Jessie<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
Lyndon was more startling even than it had seemed
last night&mdash;it might have been Jessie herself with the
additional charm of eighteen over sixteen added to
two years of cultivation, and all the advantages of a
rich and becoming dress.</p>

<p>But when he passed close by her as she lounged
in her chair her calm glance swept over him like the
veriest stranger’s, while the color rose in her cheek
at his admiring glance.</p>

<p>It was quite useless for him to seek an introduction.
No one dared penetrate their chill reserve but the captain,
and he refused Laurier’s request regretfully, saying
that the Lyndons were very offish and did not care
to know people.</p>

<p>But all day Laurier haunted her vicinity. He could
scarcely take his eyes from the beautiful, luring face
with its down-dropped eyes bent so steadily over her
book; he simply forgot his betrothed’s existence, and
kept wishing feverishly that something would happen
to make him acquainted with the fascinating stranger.</p>

<p>How terribly our wild wishes are answered sometimes!</p>

<p>Laurier did not dream that his good or evil fate
would soon grant his prayer.</p>

<p>Jessie sang again on deck that night, and Laurier
retired to toss on a restless pillow, and dream of her
all night.</p>

<p>In the dark hour that comes before the dawn a leaping
flame shot up from the steamer into the darkness,
irradiating the gloom with awful light, while panic-stricken
voices rang out upon the night, shouting:
“Fire! Fire! Fire!”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">AN OCEAN TRAGEDY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Of the horrors that attended the burning of the
<em>Atlanta</em> in mid-ocean that September night none could
clearly tell, not even the survivors, so sudden had been
the alarm, so terrible the onset of the leaping flames,
so wild the ferocity of almost every one as they fought
over the lifeboats, forgetting honor and chivalry in the
mad rush for continued existence.</p>

<p>From the first moment it was evident that the ship
was doomed. The fire had gained such headway before
it was discovered that its progress could not be
checked. So the dread alarm, “Fire! Fire! Fire!”
rang out in horror from anguished voices blending
with the roaring, leaping flames, and the sullen roar of
old ocean, both deadly enemies to mankind, and eager
for their destruction.</p>

<p>Over the hurly-burly of wind and wave and fire
rose the captain’s voice, ordering out the lifeboats, and
then the struggle for life began, intensified by the
anguished shrieks of women and children, wailing and
screaming in their despair.</p>

<p>The boats were lowered, but, alas, there would not
be room for all the <em>Atlanta’s</em> freight of human souls!</p>

<p>So the struggle for supremacy began, the young and
the strong jostling the old and weak, fighting for
place and supremacy. Ah, Heaven, that such cruelty
and selfishness should exist beneath the sky!</p>

<p>The few brave, chivalrous souls, the captain and<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
first mate among them, who insisted that the women
and children should be given first place and the men
take their chances, had their voices drowned by angry,
clamorous cries, as the traitors scrambled down the
ladder pell-mell into the boats, crowding them till they
almost sank with their heavy freight.</p>

<p>In the awful glare of light that illuminated the sea
and sky and the scene of terror, Leon Lyndon leaned
against the deck rail with his arm about his daughter,
pleading, praying the selfish wretches to take her in
and save her, though he must himself perish.</p>

<p>In the lurid scene of smoke and flame Jessie’s face
shone clear and pale as a lily, as she clasped his neck,
entreating him not to let her be separated from him.</p>

<p>“Oh, papa, darling, there is no one to love poor
Jessie but you! Think how lonely I should be in the
wide world without you, my only friend! If both
cannot be saved, let us die together!”</p>

<p>The man’s face, white already with the anguish of
despair, grew more pallid still in the lurid light that
glared on it as though her pathetic plaint went through
his heart.</p>

<p>Clasping her close as though in a last embrace, he
cried passionately:</p>

<p>“Oh, my darling, it is a cruel pass to which we are
brought, but, as for me, I am growing old, and it
does not much matter. My life has been a failure, and
there are times when I have been tempted to end it
with my own hands. But since I found you, Jessie,
you have made it sweeter, so that I would fain live
for you! But it cannot be. Even if I can persuade
those selfish men to give you a place in the lifeboat, I<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
must be left behind. In a moment we part forever!
Listen, Jessie, my sweet daughter, to the last words
of a dying man!”</p>

<p>She clasped her fair arms about his neck, and raised
her lovely face, tear-wet and pain-drawn, to his own.</p>

<p>“Papa, darling, we cannot part. Do not send me
from you!”</p>

<p>All this time a man had been lingering near them
unheeded. He could see their agony, but he could not
catch their words, drowned in the ocean’s roar and the
crackling of the flames, blent with the wild cries of the
panic-stricken passengers.</p>

<p>Leon Lyndon bent his convulsed face to his daughter’s
and pressed his lips to hers, then murmured
solemnly:</p>

<p>“Darling, you will not be alone in the world as you
said just now, and as I have made you believe in my
selfish anger. You have your mother!”</p>

<p>“Papa!” she gasped.</p>

<p>The fire roared and crackled over their heads; the
beasts still fought going down the ladder to safety,
and the man close to them watched with impatience
for the father to make some effort to save his child.</p>

</div>


<p>Leon Lyndon knew that his time was short. The
last words must be hurried, and he continued:</p>

<p>“If you escape this horror, Jessie, go to New York
to Mrs. Dalrymple. Tell her you are her daughter, sent
to her at last by her erring husband. Tell her that in
his last hour Leon Dalrymple’s heart was true to her
as from the first hour he saw her beautiful face. Tell
her he prayed her pardon for the impatient temper and
cruel pride that turned her heart against him; that
while both were wrong, he was most to blame; though
if she had only looked back the day she went she would
have seen his arms extended to take her back, and he
would have gone on his knees to beg her to stay! All
is past and gone&mdash;the hopes, the fears, the longings,
the despair, the vengeful anger that deprived her of
her child&mdash;but I have loved her always&mdash;I could not
thrust her from my heart!”</p>

<p>His strained voice broke in agony and he hid his
face against her shoulder, all the anguish of more than
eighteen years crowding on him, blent with the horror
of the moment.</p>

<p>Ah, those cruel years of separation, what agony,
what hopeless love, what mad yearnings, what unutterable
despair had been crowded in them!</p>

<p>Leon Lyndon had only one tie to bind him to life&mdash;this
fair, loving daughter&mdash;but he knew they must be
parted now, and he drew her close to the ladder, followed
by Laurier, who had been most impatiently waiting,
and again renewed his prayers to the men who
were still crowding into the last boats.</p>

<p>It was a sight to touch the coldest heart to anger to
see such selfishness, so many men crowded into the
few boats with just a few fortunate women and children
who had had husbands and fathers strong enough
to force a way for them.</p>

<p>But on deck there were a score of people, two-thirds
women and children, who were preparing to cast themselves<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
into the sea on frail planks and life preservers,
their only refuge.</p>

<p>The last boat was filled, and there was but one
woman in it. The rowers were putting off when a
loud voice cried authoritatively:</p>

<p>“Hold! You can crowd in another and you shall
take this lady, or I will sink the boat, by thunder, and
send your selfish souls to Hades!”</p>

<p>It was a threat not to be lightly treated, and the
rowers waited, turning their white, angry faces to the
ladder where a man clambered down, assisting a beautiful
young girl.</p>

<p>It was Frank Laurier who had broken in on Lyndon’s
unheeded and uncared-for pleadings, crying
abruptly:</p>

<p>“They will not hear you, sir, but give her to me
and I will force them to take her in, or I will spring
into the sea and overset the boat!”</p>

<p>And catching the astonished girl from her father’s
clasp, for the exigencies of the moment admitted of
no ceremony, he made the bold stroke that insured
Jessie’s safety, placing her swooning form in the boat
with the grumbling crew who yet dared not refuse his
command.</p>

<p>Then they rowed quickly away out of reach of the
storm of vituperations from the captain and other men
who remained on the deck working away at a raft, on
which they hoped to escape with the remaining women.</p>

<p>Laurier looked back at Leon Dalrymple as we may
call him now, and the look on his face, the pain, the
sorrow, was one never to be forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[134]</span></p>

<p>He cried out, though Laurier could not catch the
words:</p>

<p>“My God, what have I done? I have sent her
from me, penniless, with the belt of jewels, all our
worldly wealth, secured around my waist! I must
follow and cling to the boat until I can remove it and
leave it with her, my darling; then no matter what
becomes of me!”</p>

<p>The next instant he sprang over the deck rail into
the sea, and, guided by the light of lurid flames, swam
after the vanishing lifeboat.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow, I was about to propose to share with
him the spar I see floating yonder, but he is doubtless
crazed with excitement! I will follow and try to help
him, for he cannot swim long in such a sea without
support!” thought Laurier, springing into the sea and
clutching the spar.</p>

<p>At that moment the first gray light of dawn shone
over the sea, hailed with joy by scores of voices, and
the raft was quickly launched, the rest of the passengers
escaping gladly from the burning ship that was
scattering them with firebrands and cinders.</p>

<p>But the raft so hastily constructed and overcrowded,
began to give way, threatening instant destruction to
those who had trusted to its frail support.</p>

<p>At that moment an empty lifeboat was observed
floating near them, and they comprehended at once
that the first lifeboat, overcrowded with selfish men,
had somehow overturned and cast them all into the
sea. They had no time to bemoan this new horror,
they were too glad of this chance to save the imperiled
women and children.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">WAS A MIRACLE WROUGHT?</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The sea was unusually calm and smooth that morning.
A skillful swimmer could make good headway
against the tide.</p>

<p>Laurier was an athlete, and swimming lightly and
strongly after the vanishing lifeboat, he looked about
anxiously for Lyndon, hoping to assist him.</p>

<p>To his surprise and dismay not a sign was to be
seen of the fair head of the man in whom he took an
almost painful interest for the sake of his daughter.</p>

<p>His straining gaze wandered here and there over the
illuminated waters, but the glare of the burning ship
pained his eyes, and nothing could be seen but floating
débris, swirling black cinders, and the lifeboats vanishing
in the gloom of the cold, gray dawn.</p>

<p>His heart sank with pain and sympathy thinking of
the life gone down to the depths so suddenly, and the
fair daughter left fatherless.</p>

<p>“Alone among those selfish wretches who received
her so reluctantly that I feared to trust her to their
care! What will become of her, poor girl?” he
thought, and obeying a blind impulse he could not resist,
swam after the boat that he now observed had
slackened its speed as though too heavy freighted,
being sunk to the water’s edge.</p>

<p>What he hoped or expected from following he did
not know himself. The boat was so full they could
not have made any room for him. He was all alone<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
in the wide waste of waters with nothing but a spar
between him and eternity, and the chances were all
against his rescue. With his superb strength and skill
he might keep afloat for hours&mdash;or, something might
happen to end his life any moment, he could not tell.</p>

<p>He was near enough now to see that there was some
commotion in the boat as though of men struggling
together in fierce dispute, and the rowers had much ado
to keep it from being overset.</p>

<p>In the next moment the struggle was ended by a
horrible deed.</p>

<p>Several men lifted and cast out of the boat into
the sea the white-robed form of a woman that immediately
sank! Shrieks and cries as of horror echoed
from the boat upon the morning air! Then the rowers
bent to their oars, the boat shot away, and Laurier
knew that his efforts to save Jessie Lyndon had all been
in vain&mdash;the heartless fiends, fearful for their own
safety, had overpowered the more merciful minority
and cast the unwelcome passenger into the ocean.</p>

<p>Thrown into the boat in a fainting condition, Jessie
was a most undesirable burden, and for the few
that pitied her, there was a majority who scowled in
anger, declaring that the additional weight would
cause them all to lose their lives.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no, no!&mdash;let us be glad we can save her
beautiful life!” cried the only one other woman in the
boat, and dipping her hand in the water, she tenderly
laved the girl’s pale brow, trying to restore animation
to the still form.</p>

<p>But it was a long, deep swoon, and no wonder&mdash;torn
from her beloved father, leaving him to a most<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
certain death, Jessie’s nerves had quite given way.
She lay still and lifeless among them, heedless alike of
bitter imprecations or exclamations of tender pity.</p>

<p>The most of these men were the offscourings of
the passengers and crew&mdash;coarse, brutal men, selfish
to the last extreme, ignorant of sympathy or pity. One
of these men cried loudly:</p>

<p>“She is dead, and cannot be resuscitated. Let us
cast her out!”</p>

<p>“Yes, let us do it! It is ill luck carrying a dead
body!” cried a superstitious sailor.</p>

<p>Then the wrangle began, the woman and a few men
declaring that the girl was yet alive and should be
kept in the boat, others clamoring to get rid of the
helpless burden. It ended in a struggle where the
strong overpowered the weak, and amid the shrieks of
the woman and the expostulations of the more merciful
men, the unconscious form was torn from those
who would have protected it, and thrown into the sea.</p>

<p>Then the rowers bent to the oars, and under their
efforts the boat shot away, leaving Frank Laurier in
the distance, a horrified spectator of one of the most
dastardly deeds ever committed by fiends in the form
of men.</p>

<p>Fate had indeed brought Jessie Lyndon and Frank
Laurier together again under circumstances the most
awful that could be imagined&mdash;both face to face with
death, having scarcely one chance in a hundred of
escape from their perilous strait.</p>

<p>As for Jessie, the only hope lay in Frank Laurier’s
ability to reach and save her if she should rise to
the surface again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[138]</span></p>

<p>Ah, what deeds of valor Love can do! How it
fires the heart, and nerves the arm to superhuman
strength!</p>

<p>With a wild prayer to Heaven on his pallid lips, he
swam quickly toward the spot where the white form
had disappeared beneath the engulfing waves, but ere
he reached it he saw to his joy that she had risen
again and was floating on the surface, her skirts upheld
by a piece of plank on which they had caught and
become entangled.</p>

<p>His heart gave a wild, suffocating leap; his throat
swelled; hot tears of joy sprang to his dark-blue eyes
as he redoubled his efforts to reach her side.</p>

<p>Breathless, spent, exhausted with his wild struggle
to overcome death, he reached the silent, floating form
with its still, white face upturned to the sky, the golden
locks streaming loose upon the water, and he clasped
the beauteous form with the frenzy we feel when that
which is dearest to us on earth seems slipping away
from us forever.</p>

<p>“Jessie! Jessie!” he groaned, with a wild recollection
of a face so like to this that he had seen once
lying among funeral flowers in the ghastly shadow of
the old family vault. “Jessie! Jessie!” But there
came no movement of the white lips in answer to his
wild appeal.</p>

<p>Yet even dead he would not cast her from him, but
arranging her form carefully on the plank, and placing
the spar beneath himself, they floated for an hour&mdash;the
seeming dead and the anguished living side by
side, away from the burning ship slowly settling beneath<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
the waters, out on the trackless waste, while the
gray light in the sky slowly brightened.</p>

<p>Laurier’s eyes gazed on the beautiful face in mute
love and despair, while in his heart there echoed the
sweet plaint she had sung but yesternight:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">“Love, I will love you ever,
</div><div class="indent0">Love, I will leave you never,
</div><div class="indent1">Ever to me, precious to be,
</div><div class="indent0">Never to part, heart bound to heart,
</div><div class="indent0">Ever am I, never to say good-by!”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>He had never spoken one word to her, never touched
her hand, never looked into her soft, dark eyes, as he
believed, yet while she had stood there singing in the
moonlight, she had lured the heart from his breast because
she brought back to him in fancy the dead girl
he had loved too late.</p>

<p>He vowed to himself that he would never be parted
from this dead love of his, so fair and still. They
would float on together side by side until he knew
there was no longer any hope of her recovery, then
he would fold her in his arms and they would plunge
down together to the depths of ocean.</p>

<p>A sudden cry&mdash;of commingled hope, surprise, and
doubt&mdash;shrilled over his blanched lips:</p>

<p>“Ah, am I dreaming, or is this a blissful reality?
Did her lips move, her eyelids flutter?”</p>

<p>But it was no dream as he feared, no fancy of an
overwrought brain.</p>

<p>A faint tinge of color had crept into the waxen
cheek, the eyelids fluttered nervously, the lips parted
in a strangling gasp.</p>

<p>A cry of rapture escaped his lips, and at the sound<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>
so close to her ears Jessie opened wide her eyes with a
dazed look straight upon his face.</p>

<p>There was no recognition at first. It was the startled
wonder of a very young infant that looked out
upon him&mdash;an infant just waking from sleep.</p>

<p>But little by little comprehension dawned on her
mind. She recognized a familiar face presently, read
passionate love in the blue eyes fixed upon her own,
recalled his identity, and wondered why they were
drifting thus with her head upon his arm, through
sunlit seas together.</p>

<p>Laurier watched Jessie’s great, dark eyes widen and
darken with feeling, and guessed the thought in her
mind before she murmured in anguish:</p>

<p>“Papa!”</p>

<p>He answered tenderly:</p>

<p>“Afloat somewhere on the wide, wide sea, as we are,
little Jessie, and held in the hollow of the same Divine
Hand that is able to save us even from this terrible
plight. Be brave, and let us hope for the best.”</p>

<p>His voice trembled, for he knew too well how desperate
were their chances, how slender the thread of
hope to which they could cling.</p>

<p>Yet he was not at all unhappy.</p>

<p>All that the world held for him as dearest and
sweetest was beside him here in the person of this
girl almost a stranger to him, yet so fatally dear that
she blotted out everything on earth beside.</p>

<p>As for Jessie, as full memory returned and she
found herself alone with Laurier on the sunlit sea,
under his tender care, her feelings were unenviable.</p>

<p>When she heard that he was on the steamer it
brought back all the cruel past with a rush of pain.</p>

<p>When she saw him that night and the next day
and that night again on the steamer, she could hardly
bear it. When she felt him looking at her, hot blushes<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
burned her face lest he should recognize her as the
girl who had given him an unrequited love from
which he had turned in disgust.</p>

<p>But in spite of all her pride, she could not help looking
at him at the rare times when he was not looking
at her, and she saw that he was handsomer than ever,
but with a different expression, a gravity he had not
worn when she knew him first; something that was
almost sadness lurking in his dark-blue eyes, and
chastening the debonair smile that had thrilled her
heart with such subtle tenderness.</p>

<p>She knew from the captain that he had sought an
introduction to her, but she was frightened at the
bare idea of it. She would not have spoken to him
for anything the world held.</p>

<p>Then came the horrible alarm of fire, and she had
rushed from her stateroom in the white dressing
gown, warm and dainty, in which she had thrown herself
down to rest on her couch. Her father had met
her and caught her in his arms.</p>

<p>She saw Frank Laurier lingering near, but she
quickly turned her head away, saying to herself that
she would not speak to him if she were dying.</p>

<p>Such a little time afterward she had been caught
up in his arms and borne down the ladder to the boat,
swooning as soon as she was placed in it, and now&mdash;now&mdash;the
incredible horror of the thought made her
dizzy&mdash;she was lost to all the world but this man,
alone with him on the wide, wide sea, under his protection,
at his mercy.</p>

<p>How had it all come about?</p>

<p>Feminine curiosity made her put aside her vow of<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
silence, and she looked at him with wide, solemn eyes,
murmuring:</p>

<p>“Where is the boat?”</p>

<p>“You fell out of it and sank, and those wretches left
you to your fate. I saw them and swam near, catching
you as you came to the surface.”</p>

<p>“Then&mdash;I&mdash;owe&mdash;you&mdash;my&mdash;life!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, and she wondered at the sweet,
significant smile that played around his lips.</p>

<p>He dared not tell his companion, either, of how the
fiends in the boat had cast her out into the sea to
perish. The shock would be too great to her nerves,
already shattered by grief at her father’s loss.</p>

<p>He said to himself that if they escaped the perils
of the sea the time might come when he could safely
tell her these things and ask her to give him her life
that he had saved to gladden his home forever.</p>

<p>Higher and higher climbed the sun in the heavens,
and the sea glittered with a brilliancy that pained their
eyes while the whitecapped waves rocked them on the
breast of old ocean, the only living objects in the scene,
while far in the distance the smoldering hulk of the
<em>Atlanta</em> was slowly sinking from sight as it burned to
the water’s edge.</p>

<p>They kept close together, their eyes turned on the
far distance, watching for the gleam of a sail that
might presage rescue, but at last hope began to die in
their hearts, they were so weary with the buffeting
of the cruel waves and the hot glare of the sun that
they were almost ready to close their eyes on the waste
of sunlit water and sink down, down, down, through
the cool, green darkness to eternal rest.</p>

</div>


<p>It was a stroke of the rarest good fortune that Laurier
and Jessie should be saved by a homeward-bound
steamer&mdash;the <em>Scythia</em>, going straight to New York.</p>

<p>What a sensation they created when the passengers
discovered them floating in the water on the poor raft
formed of the plank and the spar.</p>

<p>A boat was quickly lowered, and they were drawn
into it with all speed, and, oh, what pity and kindness
was showered on them after their long exposure
and peril!</p>

<p>The men took charge of Laurier, and the women
of Jessie, every one eager to contribute dry clothing
and administer all needed comforts.</p>

<p>All were strangers alike to Jessie, but among the
passengers Laurier found several acquaintances, people
he had met in London barely a week ago, and
whom he knew intimately in New York.</p>

<p>Laurier satisfied their curiosity by a straightforward
recital of the burning of the <em>Atlanta</em>, then he
was glad enough to have a warm meal and to be left
to rest in his stateroom, where, spent and weary, he
remained until late next morning.</p>

<p>When he came on deck in a fairly well-fitting suit
of clothing contributed by a friend, he looked about
anxiously for Jessie, hoping she was well enough to
come out this bright, sunny morning.</p>

<p>But she was not visible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[145]</span></p>

<p>“Miss Lyndon is not well enough to come out to-day.
The doctor thinks she should rest in her stateroom
till to-morrow,” he was told.</p>

<p>He could hardly wait till to-morrow to see her
again, he was so impatient.</p>

<div class="indent0">How can I wait until you come to me?

<p>Meanwhile Jessie, really ill from fatigue and grief
over her father’s unknown fate, rested until next day,
her retirement enlivened by the visits of the ladies
who vied with each other in their attentions and condolences,
every one having fallen in love with the beautiful
stranger.</p>

<p>They thought it most romantic that such a handsome
pair as Laurier and Jessie should have been cast
away together at sea.</p>

<p>“Such an incident should end most naturally in love
and marriage,” declared Miss Chanler, who was a
very romantic girl.</p>

<p>“What a pity that Miss Ellyson should be in the
way!” added Mrs. de Vries, a young society matron in
Laurier’s set.</p>

<p>Jessie’s large eyes had an inquiring expression that
moved her to add further:</p>

<p>“Of course, you know all about his engagement?”</p>

<p>“No, I do not. I never met him until on shipboard,”
Jessie answered with seeming indifference.</p>

<p>“And you did not really know that he is going home<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
to marry a girl he has been engaged to over two
years?”</p>

<p>“No,” Jessie answered carelessly.</p>

<p>“Then we must tell you about it. The story is quite
romantic, if it will not tire you to hear it.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” she answered calmly, glad that they
could not notice her agitation.</p>

<p>So he was not married to proud, scornful Cora yet?
She wondered why, and listened eagerly to Mrs. de
Vries as she rattled on and told all that had happened
as we already know.</p>

<p>As Mrs. de Vries finished her dramatic recital, a
quick sob followed from Jessie, who was weeping the
tears that rise from a tender heart over her rival’s
calamity.</p>

<p>“Oh, I did wrong to unnerve you so. Forgive me,”
the lady cried repentantly.</p>

<p>“It is so dreadful!” Jessie sobbed, in answer, and
for some moments she found it impossible to command
her feelings.</p>

<p>Then she stifled the bursting sobs, murmuring
faintly:</p>

<p>“It was so distressing I could not help it!”</p>

<p>“It does credit to your tender heart, dear girl, but
do not forget that the story is going to end happily
after all.”</p>

<p>A flood of sympathy for Frank Laurier’s troubles
had been aroused in Jessie’s heart, blotting out all her
passionate resentments.</p>

<p>“How he has suffered through the sufferings of the
proud beauty he loved so well! And she, too, has
atoned for all her heartlessness in the ordeal she has<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
passed through. I pity them too much to hate them
any longer, and when we meet to-morrow I will be
very kind to him,” she thought.</p>

<p>It was just what Laurier had been wishing&mdash;that
she would be kind to him when they met again.</p>

<p>The next morning she came on deck in a pretty
gown of Miss Chanler’s that had been altered to fit
by a clever maid.</p>

<p>She looked lovely, though very, very pale still, as
she went up to Laurier with frankly extended hand.</p>

<p>“I am much better, and I thank you for saving my
life,” she faltered, with naïve directness.</p>

<p>“The opportunity made me very happy,” he answered,
pressing the little hand warmly as he led her
to a steamer chair, and lingered by her side, secretly
jealous of every admiring glance that came her way.</p>

<p>But how could he blame them for feasting their
eyes on such flawless beauty as Jessie Lyndon’s, as
perfect as an opening flower!</p>

<p>No one could look into those deep, soft, dark eyes
without a thrill at the heart; no one could gaze at the
perfect, crimson lips without wishing to press a kiss
on them, or to embrace the graceful young figure with
the rounded slenderness of eighteen marking its lissom
curves, while the wealth of wavy golden hair drew the
eyes again and again in irresistible admiration.</p>

<p>But it seemed that even if Frank Laurier should
fall in love with Jessie he would have several very
formidable rivals.</p>

<p>Most of the eligible young men on board vied with
each other in attentions to the newcomer.</p>

<p>They declared that she was the most beautiful<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
creature ever seen, and it was plainly to be seen that
she could have her pick and choice of lovers. It mattered
not that she was very shy and quiet, grieving always
over her father’s loss, they hovered about her
like bees about a flower, while the ladies were also so
charmed that they forgot to be jealous of the lovely
girl.</p>

<p>If Laurier was jealous he dared not say so, but the
other young fellows grumbled that just because Laurier
had saved her life he tried to monopolize all her
time&mdash;and what was the use?&mdash;for they all knew he
was going home to marry an heiress, and there was no
need to flirt with beautiful Miss Lyndon.</p>

<p>Jessie herself wondered why, under the circumstances,
he paid her so much attention, but being devoid
of vanity, she ascribed it to the natural kindliness
of his heart, and was very sweet and gentle in return,
telling herself he had been so kind she must not
repulse him these last few days when they would
soon be parted forever. There were times when she
could not help feeling that every look and action
breathed love, then she would chide herself for her
vanity.</p>

<p>“I am as vain and silly as when I thought him in
love with me before, because he showed me some
meaningless attentions just to pique the girl he loved
into jealousy. I must not fall into such a mistake
again,” she mused, trying to curb her tempestuous
heart that beat so fast at his impassioned glances.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">HOW COULD HE LOSE HER THUS?</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The days flew fast and to-morrow their eventful
journey would be over&mdash;they would land at New
York.</p>

<p>More than one heart was secretly sorry, grieving
to lose sight of one sweet passenger&mdash;lovely Jessie
Lyndon.</p>

<p>And what made the parting worse was that Jessie
gave them no hope of meeting her again, in spite of
their broad hints at renewing her acquaintance in New
York.</p>

<p>She had said to one and all that she was going to
relatives in the city, but not to any one, even Laurier,
did she disclose their names.</p>

<p>In fact, Jessie was ill at ease over the thought of
returning to her mother, because there she must meet
again the proud beauty, Cora.</p>

<p>“I must be there through all the excitement of their
wedding. How can I bear it?” she asked herself in
frank dismay.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that she could not bear the pain of
seeing him wedded to another. She would be sure
to turn pale and tremble, and thus betray the secret of
her sad heart&mdash;her unrequited love.</p>

<p>She wished that the wedding were over and done
with, so that they might be gone away on their bridal
tour before she entered the house.</p>

<p>The more she thought of it the more she felt that<span class="pagenum">[150]</span>
she could not bear the excitement of the wedding, and
at length she resolved to seek out some of her former
humble friends and remain with them until Laurier
and his bride were gone on their wedding tour.</p>

<p>That last night before they landed was the most
beautiful they had experienced. The azure dome was
gemmed with countless stars that were mirrored in
the calm sea, the moon shed a bewitching, silvery light
on everything, and the air was as soft as in midsummer.</p>

<p>Every one remained on deck till a late hour. They
had music and flirting to beguile the time, and Laurier
betrayed the fact of Jessie’s talent.</p>

<p>“Oh, why did you not tell us before?” they cried.
“Oh, do not refuse to sing for us!”</p>

<p>They had been so kind that she could not well refuse;
besides, she loved to sing as the birds love to warble.</p>

<p>She whispered to Laurier:</p>

<p>“I will do my best because they have all been so
kind to me, but I fear I shall break down thinking of
poor papa and the uncertainty of his fate.”</p>

<p>He tried to cheer her with hopeful words:</p>

<p>“Look on the bright side; your father may have
been saved just as we were, and you may soon be
reunited.”</p>

<p>“I fear not. He had a presentiment of death, I believe,
for he sent messages as from the dying to his
friends in New York,” she sighed.</p>

<p>“Still, I would not give up hope. Many people have
been known to survive terrible accidents,” he replied,
and she wondered if he was thinking of all that had
happened to him and Cora.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[151]</span></p>

<p>She sighed, and began to strum softly on the guitar
some one had offered for her accompaniments.</p>

<p>Then she sang, and the tremor in her voice made it
all the sweeter. They hung spellbound on the liquid
notes sweet as the nightingale.</p>

<p>“It is another Melba!” they cried in delight, but
some were hushed into silence, their very heartstrings
stirred by the divine strains.</p>

<p>When she stopped at last, all were clamorous for
more, but she pleaded weariness.</p>

<p>A low voice murmured in her ear:</p>

<p>“Just one more, please&mdash;the song you sang for your
father the night I first saw you.”</p>

<p>“I must have sung several,” she replied, and he answered:</p>

<p>“‘Love, I will love you ever!’”</p>

<p>The significant earnestness of the tone and words
made her heart throb so quickly that the blood mantled
her cheek with crimson. She made no answer,
just swept the strings and sang the sweet old song,
while his heart kept echoing the tender refrain:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">“Love, I will love you ever,
</div><div class="indent0">Love, I will leave you never,
</div><div class="indent0">Faithful and true,
</div><div class="indent0">Ever to me precious to be,
</div><div class="indent0">Heart bound to heart,
</div><div class="indent0">Never to part,
</div><div class="indent0">Love, I will love you ever!”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>She paused, and no one ventured to ask her to sing
again. They wished to keep the last sweet strain in
their hearts.</p>

<p>She turned her face up to the starry sky, and little<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
by little they fell away from her side, comprehending
that she preferred to be alone.</p>

<p>Soon no one was left but Laurier, and for some
little time he kept silence. It was enough to be near
her, to gaze on the lovely face upturned to the moonlit
sky, to breathe the same air with her, and to wonder
of what she was thinking with that pensive curve on
her crimson lips, whether of her dead father, or a
possible lover.</p>

<p>He started while a twinge of jealousy tore through
his heart like red-hot iron. A lover! Oh, how he
hated the thought!</p>

<p>Then another thought came to vex him.</p>

<p>To-morrow they would be parted. She was going
out of his life to unknown friends.</p>

<p>And she had shown no disposition to continue her
acquaintance with him beyond to-morrow.</p>

<p>Could he bear to lose her thus?</p>

<p>Life would be unutterably dreary without this beautiful
girl who had come into his life so strangely, and
was about to fade from it so soon.</p>

<p>His heart leaped with great, suffocating throbs. He
must speak, must know his fate!</p>

<p>He leaned closer to her till their heads almost
touched, the brown, curly one, and the wavy, golden-tressed
one.</p>

<p>“Jessie,” he faltered.</p>

<p>She started violently, and turned her face inquiringly
toward him, as he continued:</p>

<p>“Ever since that first night I saw you with your
pure face upturned to the sky, the words of your song
have echoed in my heart. Will you forgive me for<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
daring to say them over to you? ‘Love, I will love
you ever!’”</p>

<p>She could not pretend to misunderstand him. With
dilated, wondering eyes, she gazed at him, as he continued
thrillingly:</p>

<p>“I know this seems strange to you&mdash;strange and
abrupt. But once before I knew and loved a Jessie
Lyndon, so like to you that you might have been twin
sisters. Perhaps you have had a near relative of that
name?” anxiously.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE HEART OF A LOVER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The stars shone on, the wind sighed, the sea moaned,
but Jessie’s heart almost stopped still.</p>

<p>The moment she had dreaded had come at last.</p>

<p>He was asking her about that other Jessie Lyndon.</p>

<p>And she would have to answer so that he would not
suspect her identity.</p>

<p>Her heart beat suffocatingly and almost choked her
voice as she tried to speak. “I have startled you, venturing
so abruptly on this subject,” he said. “I would
have waited longer, only that we shall be parting to-morrow,
and I feared lest I should never see you
again. Ah, Jessie, that is such a horrible thought to
me. I could not bear it! I cannot bear to think that
I shall never see you again! I love you&mdash;love you
with a passion undreamed of till now! Are you willing
for me to love you, to let me try to win your heart
in return?”</p>

<p>A sudden flash of pride shone in her eyes, and she
tried to answer him with scornful words, but they
died on her lips.</p>

<p>She loved him so dearly, oh, Heaven, in spite of all
her resolves against it, that she could not bring herself
to say one cruel word to him, no matter how much
she knew he was to blame. If she could have known
that he was speaking truly, that he actually loved her,
as he said, and had he but been free she would have
fallen against his breast, and sobbed out all her love in
his arms, the happiest girl in the whole world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[155]</span></p>

<p>But once he had deceived her, and in fancy his kiss
burned on her lips again&mdash;sweetest and falsest kiss the
world ever knew.</p>

<p>She nerved herself to lift her head and drew back
from him in sad surprise while he exclaimed ardently:</p>

<p>“You do not answer me, Jessie&mdash;may I hope, then,
or&mdash;&mdash;” The words died on his lips, for she interrupted
reproachfully:</p>

<p>“Mr. Laurier, you have no right to speak such
words to me&mdash;you who are going to New York to
marry another girl!”</p>

<p>He gave a cry as if stunned, and his face drooped
against his breast.</p>

<p>He had been forgetting Cora for many a day. This
lovely girl had driven her from his memory.</p>

<p>Thus suddenly recalled to memory by her gently reproachful
words, he groaned in agony, not daring to
meet her dark, soft eyes.</p>

<p>“Is it not true?” she asked gently, but, looking up,
he groaned angrily:</p>

<p>“It is Mrs. de Vries who has told you this! She
was always a noted gossip!”</p>

<p>“Yes, she told me, but why should she not, if it is
true, and you do not deny it,” she faltered, almost
hoping that he could.</p>

<p>But Frank Laurier could not be untruthful. A
bursting sigh heaved his breast as she watched him
with pathetic, dark eyes.</p>

<p>He turned on her almost fiercely, crying:</p>

<p>“You think me a vile wretch, do you not?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;but&mdash;a flirt&mdash;perhaps!” pensively, and he<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
gathered himself together to do battle for his happiness.</p>

<p>“I am not a flirt, Jessie, but I may be a vile wretch,
for since the first night I saw you I have entirely forgotten
the poor girl I am engaged to marry. Instead
of loving her I almost hate her because she stands
between your heart and mine!”</p>

<p>He paused, looking at her, and found her expression
doubtful and wondering.</p>

<p>“That sounds very fickle and cruel to you, does it
not?” he cried, “but let me explain, and you will see
that I am not quite so bad as I seem. I was engaged
to Cora two years ago, but just before our wedding
day I met a girl&mdash;the Jessie Lyndon I spoke of to
you just now&mdash;and there was a bitter rivalry between
the two young girls, for I admired Jessie Lyndon very
much. But I was bound to Cora and must keep my
promise. The girl Jessie died very suddenly, and then
I found out strangely that she was dearer to my heart
than the living Cora. But I kept my secret locked in
my heart, and would have married her the same only
that our marriage has been twice postponed by a
strange fatality. Now it is announced for the third
time, and I am going home to marry her, but in the interval
of my absence my heart has turned from her as
utterly as if it had never known one throb of love
for her in the past.”</p>

<p>She did not answer. She was dazed and full of
wonder.</p>

<p>He had said such astonishing words that she could
not forget them. Why did he think she was dead?
How had he made so strange a mistake?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[157]</span></p>

<p>He added feverishly:</p>

<p>“All this while I have been loving Jessie Lyndon
dead better than Cora Ellyson living, and when I saw
you that night on the steamer my heart went out to
you passionately as if you had risen from the dead in
answer to my yearning prayer. It would be wrong to
wed Cora with my heart full of you! I will go to
her and confess the truth, and ask her to release me so
that I may lay my life at your feet!”</p>

<p>Oh, what a moment of triumph for Jessie Lyndon!</p>

<p>When she remembered that awful night at Mrs.
Dalrymple’s it seemed too strange to be true that she
had won from proud, scornful Cora the lover whom
she worshiped, thus paying back scorn for scorn.</p>

<p>And she could not doubt he loved her now. It
quivered in his voice, and flushed his cheek, thrilling
her with a secret happiness too deep for words.</p>

<p>Her heart cried wildly:</p>

<p>“Oh, if he were but free, my handsome lover,
I would confess my love and make him happy!”</p>

<p>But the thought of Cora came over her with an icy
chill.</p>

<p>He had belonged to her first, and, after all her suffering,
Jessie was too noble a rival to break that proud
girl’s heart.</p>

<p>She turned her face from him to the shining stars
so that he could not read the despairing love written on
it, and answered, firmly though gently:</p>

<p>“I forbid you to tell her the truth, for I can never
accept happiness based on the wreck of another devoted
heart. You must marry Cora as you promised
to do, and, perhaps, you will learn to love her again!”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE BLACKMAILER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Madame Barto’s doorbell clanged impatiently twice,
and then a deeply veiled young lady was admitted, and
shown to the small parlor where madame received
her callers. She glanced around her, muttering:</p>

<p>“Almost two years since I was here, yet how
familiar everything appears! Madame herself would
have the same old lying story to tell, perchance, if I
were to cross her palm again with silver! Pah! the
dingy hole disgusts me. I wish that wretch would
hasten! I have no time to waste here, and Aunt Verna
so ill that it was unseemly for me to quit the house.”</p>

<p>She paced up and down the floor with the impatience
of a caged lioness.</p>

<p>“Why don’t he come? It is money again, I suppose!
Money&mdash;always money! And since my unfaithful
guardian speculated with my money and lost
so much of it, I have scarcely enough for my own
needs. I shall be glad when I am safely married to
Frank, for then I shall defy Carey Doyle to do his
worst. I can deny his story if he dares bring any
charges, and Frank Laurier, I know, will defend his
wife’s honor to the last. Ah, how I long to see him
again, my love, my own! His steamer is due to-day,
and I am wild with impatience. Ah! what cruel suspense
I have endured since he went away. And even
now I dread the meeting. My beauty is not as brilliant
as before my terrible accident, and I shall always<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
be compelled to depend on cosmetics to aid the charms
that before were unsurpassed!”</p>

<p>She flung back her thick veil and paused before a
mirror, studying her face intently, as she had contracted
a habit of doing now.</p>

<p>She was indeed changed from the brilliant Cora of
two years ago.</p>

<p>The beauty specialists had done their best, but they
could not restore all that the cruel flames had licked up
so relentlessly that fatal wedding eve.</p>

<p>She had tried to cheat Frank Laurier, but she could
not cheat herself, and she dreaded inexpressibly the
moment of their meeting.</p>

<p>“Will his love survive the change? Has it, indeed,
survived our long parting?” she asked herself anxiously,
for she had not failed to notice how indifferent
his letters had been, and how few and far between.</p>

<p>She thought:</p>

<p>“Perhaps he thinks I should release him, and that
his indifference will goad me into it, but I will never
do it, not even if he asked me! After all, I am afraid
Frank is rather fickle in his love! He turned from
me to another&mdash;that Jessie Lyndon that my aunt
claimed as her daughter. If she had lived, I fear she
would have made me trouble with Frank, for he must
have secretly admired her, and it is fortunate for me
in all ways that she died&mdash;for one thing, on account of
her rivalry; the other, that now Aunt Verna will leave
me her millions when she dies! And that may not be
long, for she is certainly very ill now, and&mdash;ah!” her
low soliloquy ended with a start as a young man
abruptly entered the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[160]</span></p>

<p>“Good morning, Miss Ellyson. I am glad you
obeyed my summons so promptly,” he sneered, with
coarse triumph.</p>

<p>She frowned angrily as she cried:</p>

<p>“You are impertinent, Carey Doyle. How dared
you summon me here?”</p>

<p>“You have ignored all my letters asking for money,
and I had too much respect for your position to annoy
you at your aunt’s, so I thought it was the best plan for
you to meet me here and discuss matters.”</p>

<p>“What is it that you wish?”</p>

<p>“Money, of course!”</p>

<p>“Wretch! I have paid you over and over for keeping
that miserable secret!”</p>

<p>“You have not paid me half that it was worth to
you, my proud lady!” Carey Doyle answered boldly.</p>

<p>She was furious with rage, her eyes gleaming, her
face death-white, her small hands clenched. She
thought bitterly that she wished he were dead and
lying by the side of her victim down in the old stone
quarry, the thought of whose ghastly secret had kept
her sleepless many a night.</p>

<p>But she had reasoned to herself many a time that
the crime could never be traced to her, for she had
covered up the clues too cleverly by her story of his
suicidal threats.</p>

<p>Even if they were to find the whitening bones of
Ernest Noel down in the dim old quarry, they could
not fasten his death on anybody. They would simply
believe he had carried out his threat of suicide.</p>

<p>Her anger blazed at the thought that in this insolent
man, the witness of her evil deed, lay her only peril.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[161]</span></p>

<p>“I will not give you any more money, I have exhausted
my resources. Besides, I am not afraid of
your story. You will not dare repeat it, for I would
give you into custody for attempted blackmail!” she
hissed threateningly.</p>

<p>But Carey Doyle’s laugh was not reassuring. It
stung her to fury, yet inspired her with alarm, though
she persisted:</p>

<p>“I am not afraid of you. No one will take your
word against mine!”</p>

<p>“You may risk it if you choose,” he answered, with
persistent nonchalance.</p>

<p>She measured him with a scornful glance, but she
could not cow him, and her heart sank with fear.</p>

<p>By to-morrow Frank Laurier would be in New
York. Within a week, if woman’s wit could compass
it, she would be his wife. Dare she risk any disclosure
that might rouse her lover’s suspicions, and
so postpone the wedding again?</p>

<p>She groaned in spirit, but she decided that she dare
not defy Carey Doyle until she had a husband to defend
her against his charges.</p>

<p>“How much do you require?”</p>

<p>“Just one thousand dollars!”</p>

<p>“You ask too much.”</p>

<p>“I cannot do with less.”</p>

<p>“You must!”</p>

<p>“I will not!”</p>

<p>They glared at each other, but she saw that she could
not shake his resolution.</p>

<p>Swallowing her rage and chagrin, she expostulated:</p>

<p>“It is but a month ago I gave you five hundred dollars&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;since<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>
that night you helped me you
have had four thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“For which I am most profoundly grateful,” airily,
“and a poor price for such a secret, too, so you
shouldn’t mind a last payment such as I ask for now.”</p>

<p>“A last payment! You will be calling for more in
a week.”</p>

<p>“I swear to you I will not. I am about to leave the
city for Alaska.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean it?”</p>

<p>“As surely as the sun shines in the heavens this
bright September day! Perhaps you have read, Miss
Ellyson, of the wonderful gold finds in Alaska that
have stirred the whole country into a fever. Well, I
have joined a party to go out to the gold diggings,
and I mean to make my fortune or lose my life, whichever
fate wills. It will cost me a thousand dollars to
get to the Klondike, so you see I shall have no means
of returning from those frozen wilds till I make my
pile. Surely you would not begrudge a thousand dollars
to be rid of me forever?”</p>

<p>No, she would not. It would be a small price to
pay to rid herself of this terrible incubus.</p>

<p>She had read in all the newspapers of the perils
of the awful journey to Alaska, and she thought in
her heart with joy that surely he could never return
from beyond the far Yukon.</p>

<p>Cora had shuddered at the tales of Alaska, but now
she brightened at the thought that Carey Doyle was
not, indeed, likely to return from so grim a journey.</p>

<p>“Since you need it so much and promise never to<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
ask for more, I will try to get the sum for you within
the week,” she said, adding:</p>

<p>“I will send a letter to this address telling you
when and how I will pay it to you. Is that satisfactory?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly, for I know you will keep your word,”
he replied, smiling to himself at the victory he had
won over the haughty girl who scorned him even while
she cringed beneath his power.</p>

<p>She inclined her head haughtily, drew down the
thick veil again, and swept out of the house down to
her waiting limousine, and so back to Mrs. Dalrymple’s,
where, since her return from the hospital, she
again made her home, the Van Dorns being indefinitely
absent in Paris.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“A BREAKING HEART,” SHE SAID.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mrs. Dalrymple had never felt like a well woman
since the day she kissed her daughter’s dead face and
turned away from the old family vault, feeling that her
last hope in life was gone.</p>

<p>Alone and lonely, though she had the whole world
at command by the power of wealth, Verna Dalrymple,
still a young woman, and a magnificently beautiful one,
was as wretched as the veriest beggar starving in the
streets.</p>

<p>Never since the moment she had turned from her
angry young husband, doubting his love and hating
his poverty, had Verna Dalrymple known a really
happy hour.</p>

<p>Despite her pride and resentment that had driven
them apart, she had loved Leon, her husband, with the
passion of her life, and realized it too late.</p>

<p>The decree of divorce she had permitted her parents
to secure for her fell like the trump of doom upon her
heart, and the coming of her child had been her only
consolation.</p>

<p>All these years she had fought down with resolution
the passion of her heart, loving and hating alternately
the man whose brief appearance on the stage of her
life had been as fateful as a tragedy.</p>

<p>Yet she knew not if he were dead or living, for
never since the moment of their parting had she gazed
on his fair, handsome face.</p>

<p>The divorce case, based on nonsupport and incompatibility<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
of temper, had been cleverly managed by
her lawyers without bringing them together again, and
when she fainted on receiving the decree of divorce,
all supposed it was from hysterical excitement; none
guessed that the iron of despair had entered her soul
on knowing herself parted forever from Leon Dalrymple.</p>

<p>She clung to his name still, with the excuse that it
was for the sake of the unborn child, that it might
bear the paternal name.</p>

<p>But with the coming of the beloved daughter one
bitter drop always mingled with her cup of joy.</p>

<p>It was that he could not share her happiness.</p>

<p>His child looked at her with its father’s face, and
had the sunny curls that had crowned his handsome
head.</p>

<p>There was wordless reproach in the resemblance.</p>

<p>Four years the child remained the idol of her life,
and kept alive in her heart the father’s memory&mdash;then
the blow fell that almost crushed her&mdash;the loss of the
child!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[166]</span></p>

<p>It was stolen while taking an airing in the park with
its nurse.</p>

<p>The maid had been flirting with a policeman&mdash;she
said she had only just turned her head&mdash;when the
little darling had been snatched up by a stranger&mdash;a
man with a black wig and bushy whiskers who got
away with the child in spite of her pursuit.</p>

<p>On being cross-questioned, the maid admitted that
the little girl had previously made the acquaintance of
a blond gentleman with a melancholy aspect, and the
two&mdash;Darling and the gentlemanly stranger&mdash;had become
fast friends.</p>

<p>The little one would run to meet him, shouting with
joy when he appeared, usually with a sweet bunch of
flowers or a new toy. They would sit together on a
bench a while, and Darling would prattle to him joyously,
then with a long-drawn sigh he would leave
the spot and reappear several days afterward, always
meeting a glad welcome from the child. She did not
think it was any harm as he seemed such a perfect
gentleman. And she was sure it was not he who had
kidnapped the child. It was a dark man, all bushy,
black whiskers and wig.</p>

<p>The girl was lying; because she had been so busy
with her flirtation that she did not know just when
the child ran away to meet the blond gentleman beckoning
from a distance, and threw herself into his
arms. Then it was easy enough to whip into a carriage
with her and away.</p>

<p>So the frightened nurse stuck to her story of the
dark stranger, but the mother’s heart was not deceived.
She knew that Darling’s abductor was no<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>
one but her father, who, cheated of her sweetness all
these years, had thus taken his revenge.</p>

<p>For a while the most bitter resentment possessed the
mother’s heart.</p>

<p>She employed detectives, and spared neither time,
money, nor patience in the effort to recover the child.</p>

<p>For several years the search went on, ending at
last without success.</p>

<p>Leon Dalrymple, who had placed his child with his
sister, the wife of a poor artisan in an obscure part
of the city, and then sailed for Europe himself, had
so cleverly covered up his tracks that Mrs. Dalrymple’s
daughter was reared in poverty in the same city
where her mother was rolling in wealth, yet as effectively
separated as if continents had rolled between
them.</p>

<p>So the years went on, and Mrs. Dalrymple, plunging
into the social whirl, tried to drown her grief in
vain.</p>

<p>Her parents died, and their large fortune fell to
her, the only surviving child. Then she took her
orphan niece, Cora Ellyson, into her home and heart.</p>

<p>But in no sense could Cora fill the lost child’s place.
She was passionate, self-willed, imperious, and ungrateful.
Her aunt wearied of her often, despairing
of any congeniality between them, and secretly anxious
that Cora should marry and thus remove to another
home.</p>

<p>Then came the episode of Jessie Lyndon, the wonderful
likeness that startled Mrs. Dalrymple, and the
discovery of the family birthmark on the young girl’s
breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[168]</span></p>

<p>Swiftly the links were fastened in the chain that
proved the dead girl to be the stolen child, recovered
only in death.</p>

<p>It was cruel, cruel! The woman’s heart so long
on the rack of suspense almost broke beneath the awful
strain of hope’s decay.</p>

<p>After Jessie’s death and Cora’s accident no one
thought it strange that she gave up society, draping
herself in the deepest mourning garb.</p>

<p>In her restless mood before finding Jessie she had
promised to marry a titled Englishman, who, meeting
her abroad, had followed her home to plead his suit.</p>

<p>Now she abruptly canceled this engagement, to the
despair of her suitor, who adored her beauty as much
as he did her millions.</p>

<p>Her heart had never been in it. No man had
touched that since she had been parted from her husband,
but she had thought to fill up her empty life
with gratified vanity, to wear the tiara of a duchess.</p>

<p>Her heart revolted, and she realized that she would
do her lover wrong to give him the hand without the
heart.</p>

<p>So, in spite of his entreaties, she took back her
promise, and set society caviling as much as it had
done at her divorce. She did not care. She was
growing indifferent to everything now that she had
found Darling and lost her again in death.</p>

<p>So it happened that as time went by she lost heart
and hope, sickening of a vague disease without a name,
the slow loss of interest in life that had nothing left to
make it dear.</p>

<p>She lay ill on her bed at last, and the old family<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>
physician came and shook his head and said it must
be nervous prostration.</p>

<p>“It is a breaking heart,” she replied wearily.</p>

<p>“No, no.”</p>

<p>“I tell you yes,” she cried. “It was too cruel a
blow, finding Darling and losing her again as I did. I
have never recovered from it. The thorn has been
in my heart always, and I can never recover.”</p>

<p>“You should have married the duke. It would have
diverted your mind to wear a coronet.”</p>

<p>“It would only have wearied me,” she replied, and
the look in her great, languid, dark eyes made his old
heart ache. “You may spare your pills and potions,
doctor. They cannot cure me, for I do not wish to
get well. I am reaping the crop of pain I sowed in
my passionate youth, and I am weary of life!”</p>

<p>“You should have married another man and forgotten
that episode,” he said; but she turned her face
to the wall with a stifled moan:</p>

<p>“I could not forget!”</p>

<p>And he went away perplexed and unhappy, realizing
that the medical art could not avail to cure that
subtle malady&mdash;hopelessness and weariness of life.</p>

<p>So it happened that she grew worse and worse,
weaker and weaker. She swallowed the doctor’s
tonics patiently; but they did not do her any good, and
she smiled sorrowfully when he chided her because she
would not make an effort to live.</p>

<p>“The world is empty,” she murmured again, turning
her lovely, pallid face to the wall.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“BILLING AND COOING WILL WAIT.”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>So it happened that on the day when the <em>Scythia</em>
came into port&mdash;the same day that Cora Ellyson went
to Madame Barto’s at Carey Doyle’s command&mdash;Mrs.
Dalrymple lay so ill that Cora felt it wrong to leave
the house even for a moment.</p>

<p>Yet she dared not disobey the commands of her
merciless tyrant.</p>

<p>On returning home she received a note from Frank
Laurier announcing that he had arrived in New York
that morning and would call on her that evening. The
poor fellow having been parted from Jessie by her
own decree of separation, had no resource now but to
return to Cora, and most bitter indeed was the penalty.</p>

<p>He would never forget that night when his beautiful
love had so gently forbidden him to hope to win
her and bade him return to Cora.</p>

<p>Prayers and entreaties were of no avail; she put
them gently aside, saying:</p>

<p>“Even if I loved you, how could I be happy with
you when you had broken another’s heart for my
sake?”</p>

<p>True as truth herself, she could not contemplate such
treachery calmly, even though Cora had treated her so
cruelly that many would have held it a fair revenge.</p>

<p>He took her little hand in spite of her protest, and
held it, and it fluttered like a little, white bird in his
clasp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[171]</span></p>

<p>He looked full into her eyes, and, oh, how soft and
dark they were, as if full of unshed tears.</p>

<p>“Answer me one question,” he said: “If I had been
free to woo you, if there had been no Cora who held
my promise, could you have given me your love?”</p>

<p>In the beautiful moonlight he saw her bosom heave
with emotion, and she faltered sadly:</p>

<p>“You must pardon me for not answering that question.”</p>

<p>Then she tore her hand away, and fled from him in
the wildest haste. He saw her no more till next morning
in the rush of leaving.</p>

<p>He went up to her, saying:</p>

<p>“We shall be landing presently. Shall I take you
to your friends, Jessie?”</p>

<p>She looked up at him very pale and constrained.</p>

<p>“My&mdash;my&mdash;friends are very plain, humble people&mdash;not
at all in your set, Mr. Laurier.”</p>

<p>“No matter how humble, I would like to see you
safely to them,” he said.</p>

<p>“It will not be necessary, I thank you. Mrs. de
Vries has lent me the money for a cab, and I shall
know where to go, as I have only been away from
New York two years,” she replied quietly.</p>

<p>“You will at least allow me to see you safely on
shore, and to find you a cab?”</p>

<p>“I shall be very grateful,” with a gentle smile.</p>

<p>After that, in the rush and confusion, he could
say no more, but he stayed by her side and waited
through all the excitement of the merry adieus, noting
how popular she had become in the few days on the
<em>Scythia</em>, so that every one wished to touch her hand<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
and wish her a happy future. At last he was leading
her down the gangplank, saying to her with a mournful
attempt at cheerfulness that the fire on the <em>Atlanta</em>
had saved them the bother of having their luggage
examined and paying customhouse duties.</p>

<p>A cab was found much sooner than he desired, and
he stood by it, holding her hand very tight, longing
to never let it go.</p>

<p>“Are we never to meet again?” he asked mournfully,
and she answered, very low:</p>

<p>“We must, I fear, for our social circles may one
day be the same&mdash;but not yet&mdash;not until&mdash;after you&mdash;are&mdash;married!”</p>

<p>She almost gasped as she uttered the last words,
and tottered into the taxi, sinking heavily into the
seat.</p>

<p>“Where to, lady?” asked the chauffeur, and she
whispered a reply that Frank did not hear.</p>

<p>The door banged, the machine started, and he stood
gazing after the taxi with his heart in his eyes as
lonely in that gay, bustling throng as though stranded
on a desert shore.</p>

<p>He hurried to his bachelor lodgings. He had written
to his servants to make ready for his coming.
From there he wrote, by and by, the note to Cora
announcing his return, and his intention of calling on
her that evening. He hurried to Mrs. Dalrymple’s
mansion that evening, but while he waited for Cora’s
entrance, a sad-faced servant informed him that she<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
would be with him as soon as she could leave her aunt,
who was so ill that she was not expected to survive the
night.</p>

<p>A rush of surprise and grief over this startling news
drove his own troubles, temporarily, from the young
man’s mind.</p>

<p>Five minutes later Cora hurried into the room,
superbly attired, dabbing her eyes with a damp handkerchief,
inwardly thankful that this show of grief
would account for the vanished luster of her once
bright orbs.</p>

<p>“Frank, dearest!” she cried, throwing herself upon
his breast.</p>

<p>They sat down a little apart from each other by
his own maneuver, while he said anxiously:</p>

<p>“This distressing news of Mrs. Dalrymple has driven
everything else out of my head. Is it really so bad,
Cora?”</p>

<p>“It is the strangest case I ever heard of, Frank.
Aunt Verna has been steadily declining for long
months of a malady so obscure that no doctor can
diagnose it, and she declares herself that it is a breaking
heart.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how sad, how pitiful!” he cried, and his
thoughts returned to the day when he had seen her
bending, a sad, black-draped figure, over her daughter’s
bier. So this was the cruel end.</p>

<p>His betrothed continued sorrowfully:</p>

<p>“It will break my heart to lose my dear Aunt Verna,
even though I shall be the heiress of all her millions!”</p>

<p>She thought it was a good idea to remind him slyly
of this fact, but he looked at her coldly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[174]</span></p>

<p>“You should not be counting on such things, Cora.
It sounds mercenary,” he said, rebukingly, while all
the while his eyes were taking in the change that had
come over her once brilliant beauty&mdash;faded like a
rose that has languished in the withering heat of an
August day.</p>

<p>She looked at him reproachfully:</p>

<p>“Oh, Frank, I did not mean it that way, I love Aunt
Verna dearly, and I am praying that she will not die.”</p>

<p>“Is there the slightest hope?”</p>

<p>“The doctors say if she had some shock to arouse
her and draw her thoughts from herself, it might do
good, but she cares about nothing. She has not shown
any animation to-day, except a faint spark of interest
when I told her you were coming.”</p>

<p>“I should so love to see her again. Shall I have
that sad pleasure?” he asked, eager to escape from the
tête-à-tête interview with Cora, now that he could not
tax her at once with her treachery.</p>

<p>“She asked that you should come to her a while,”
Cora answered, and then added sobbingly:</p>

<p>“But have you nothing more to say to me, dear
Frank, after your long absence? How cold and careless
you seem.”</p>

<p>“Billing and cooing will wait. Let us go to your
aunt now, Cora,” he answered, rising impatiently.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“HOW WAS IT THAT LOVE DIED?”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Let us go to your aunt now, Cora,” repeated
Frank impatiently, and though her anger blazed at his
coldness, she dared not give rein to it lest she lose him
forever.</p>

<p>With a deep, quivering sigh she slipped her arm
through his, and led him upstairs to the elegant suite
of apartments where her aunt lay dying.</p>

<p>In an exquisite apartment furnished with Oriental
magnificence, and sweet with the breath of roses in
golden jardinières, while a soft, pearly light was diffused
over everything by burning wax lights, Mrs.
Dalrymple lay faintly breathing on a low, white couch,
wrapped in a rich, white cashmere gown, girdled at
the waist by a golden cord, her long, luxuriant tresses
floating loose in ebon blackness over the pillow.</p>

<p>When Cora entered the room she led Frank Laurier
straight to the couch, saying gently:</p>

<p>“Are you asleep, Aunt Verna? Here is Frank
come to see you.”</p>

<p>At these words her eyes opened with a transient
gleam of interest, and her white hand fluttered toward
him while she murmured:</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you, Frank. You were always one
of my favorites.”</p>

<p>He pressed her hand warmly, uttering words of deep
sympathy as he sank into the chair the maid placed
for him, then a slight pause ensued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[176]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Dalrymple’s eyes rested on the pair sitting side
by side, and she said, with gentle interest:</p>

<p>“You have been gone a long time, Frank. Have
you had many adventures?”</p>

<p>“None but the burning of my ship in mid-ocean
while returning,” he replied, causing Cora to exclaim:</p>

<p>“Good heavens!”</p>

<p>Then he remembered that his betrothed had told him
the doctors said that something to take Mrs. Dalrymple’s
thought from brooding on herself might
prove most beneficial, so he continued:</p>

<p>“You would find it quite a thrilling story if you
were not too ill to listen to the telling.”</p>

<p>She sighed softly. “I am a dying woman, Frank.
The blight of weariness, of ennui, of heart loneliness,
has fallen on my life, and I am fading from earth, yet
I have still a little human interest left, and it will not
tire me to listen to your story.”</p>

<p>She had brightened perceptibly, this strange woman
who lay there sinking into death, not of any vital
trouble, but merely of morbid grief and despair that
she could not quell.</p>

<p>So Frank plunged into the story of the <em>Atlanta’s</em>
burning, and, seeing that her eyes rested on him with
gentle interest, he told it in most eloquent fashion,
dwelling at length on the beautiful girl he had rescued.</p>

<p>The invalid’s eyes brightened with interest, while a
faint pink crept into her waxen cheek, but presently
Cora’s jealousy broke bounds, and she exclaimed
sharply.</p>

<p>“Pray tell us the name of this paragon of beauty&mdash;this<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
bewitching combination of dark eyes, dimples,
rosy cheeks, and golden hair!”</p>

<p>A moment’s hesitation, and he answered frankly:</p>

<p>“Miss Jessie Lyndon!”</p>

<p>“Ah-h!”</p>

<p>The stifled cry came from Mrs. Dalrymple’s suddenly
blanched lips, and her dark eyes closed as if in
death.</p>

<p>“You have killed her!” Cora cried to him angrily,
but the maid came and knelt by her mistress, chafing
her cold hands till her eyes opened again.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” Frank began contritely, but she
smiled faintly, saying:</p>

<p>“That name gave me a shock, but I am better now,
and I find your story strangely interesting. Go on&mdash;tell
me more of Jessie Lyndon.”</p>

<p>“There is no more to tell, except that I fear her
father must, indeed, have perished in the cruel sea,
leaving the poor girl an orphan,” he replied, wondering
at the change that began to come over her, the
quick flush of color to cheeks and lips, the renewed
luster of the fading, eyes. She did not look like a
dying woman, now, as she cried feverishly:</p>

<p>“Tell me all you know of Jessie Lyndon’s father!”</p>

<p>“Dear Aunt Verna, I fear this excitement must be
very bad for you. Let me take Frank away!” interposed
Cora jealously.</p>

<p>“No, no, I am better&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;am interested. Let
him stay and tell me more of this interesting father
and daughter,” her aunt faltered, and with a smoldering
flash in her dark eyes, Cora sank back into her
chair, while Frank answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[178]</span></p>

<p>“I know but little more to tell! Leon Lyndon, as
he was called, was a very reticent man, making no
friends among the passengers, keeping coldly aloof
with a moody air like a man with a tragic past.”</p>

<p>“A tragic past! Well, and his looks? Was he dark
or fair?”</p>

<p>“He was fair, with wavy, golden hair, slightly
streaked with gray&mdash;dark-blue eyes, and a fair mustache.
In his youth he must have been rarely handsome,
but he could not be less than forty now.”</p>

<p>She cried out tremblingly:</p>

<p>“The very description of my divorced husband&mdash;the
man that stole Darling from me, and broke my
heart. And the girl, was she like him, tell me!”</p>

<p>Frank Laurier answered excitedly:</p>

<p>“She was the living picture of the dead Jessie Lyndon&mdash;the
girl you buried as your daughter.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Frank&mdash;&mdash;” began Cora rebukingly, but
at that moment a maid appeared at the door, beckoning
her away, and saying:</p>

<p>“There’s a young lady downstairs insisting on seeing
Mrs. Dalrymple, and I told her I would call you.”</p>

<p>“I will come,” Cora answered quickly, then, looking
back at Frank, “Please do not tell Aunt Verna any
more startling stories while I am gone.”</p>

<p>She vanished, and Frank looked back at the invalid
in whom a startling improvement had certainly taken
place.</p>

<p>Motioning to the maid for some cordial that stood
on the table, she swallowed it eagerly, then said:</p>

<p>“Suzanne, you may go into the dressing room within
call if I need you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[179]</span></p>

<p>The maid retired, and she turned a piteous gaze on
Frank Laurier’s sympathetic face.</p>

<p>“Oh, Frank, you have roused me to life again!” she
moaned. “This story, it actually thrills me with hope!
Yet&mdash;yet&mdash;how foolish I am! How could she be my
daughter whose dead face I kissed in the coffin, whom
I left in the old family vault among the dead-and-gone
Van Dorns? But, oh, if I could only see her face!
Do you think you can find her and bring her to me to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“I will try,” he replied, but he knew it would be no
easy task. It seemed to him that Jessie Lyndon meant
to hide herself from him.</p>

<p>She closed her eyes and lay still for a few moments,
her bosom heaving with excited gasps, the color coming
and going on her wasted cheeks.</p>

<p>Then she clutched his hand with her cold, damp fingers,
crying:</p>

<p>“I cannot die till I have seen this girl who has a face
like my dead child’s, Frank. Frank, I have a feverish
fancy&mdash;perhaps a dying fancy! But will you try
to gratify it?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I will,” he replied heartily.</p>

<p>“Bend closer, let me whisper it&mdash;for I shouldn’t like
Cora or Suzanne to hear, and you will not betray me,
will you?”</p>

<p>“Never, I promise you!”</p>

<p>“It is this: Go early to-morrow to the old family
vault at Greenwood, make the sexton open it, and
look in that white casket and see if Darling is still
there, or&mdash;if her father has stolen her away and
brought her to life again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[180]</span></p>

<p>It was the strangest fancy he had ever heard, and
it made him shudder to think of that gruesome visit
to the old Van Dorn vault, but we can refuse nothing
to the dying.</p>

<p>“I will do what you wish,” he answered, just in
time, for Cora entered at that moment, visibly nervous,
but trying hard to conceal the signs of a terrible agitation.</p>

<p>She glanced suspiciously from one to the other,
crying:</p>

<p>“Aunt Verna, how excited you look. I fear you
are much worse!”</p>

<p>“No, Cora, I feel strangely better, as if Frank’s
visit had done me much good.”</p>

<p>“It has done me much good, too&mdash;made me glad and
happy! Oh, aunt, I hope you will get well in time for
our wedding next week,” cried Cora, leaning a trembling
hand on her betrothed’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Next week!” he cried, with a start of dismay that
Cora affected to misunderstand.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have arranged to have it next week, for
what is the use of any further delay? We have waited
long enough, you and I, for our happiness, have we
not, dear? So everything is ready for our wedding
and flitting next week. And because Aunt Verna is
sick it shall be the quietest sort of a ceremony&mdash;no
wedding breakfast, nor excitement&mdash;just a few friends
for witnesses, and the marriage in my traveling gown&mdash;then
the bridal tour. I have even planned that. We
will go to California. Shall you not like that, dear?”</p>

<p>It made her furious that he grew so deadly pale,
that he stammered, when he tried to answer. She<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
guessed with a sick heart that he would get out of it
all if he could.</p>

<p>“All for the sake of that hateful girl&mdash;that Jessie
Lyndon, number two, who has again come between me
and happiness!” she thought bitterly.</p>

<p>She linked her hands in his arm and drew him away.</p>

<p>“Aunt Verna is tired now. Come away, and I will
let you see her again to-morrow,” she said coaxingly.</p>

<p>They went back to the drawing-room, and she sat
down by his side on a velvet fauteuil, still keeping her
hands clasped in his arm.</p>

<p>But he sat by her pale and distrait, no pulse in his
being answering to her blandishments.</p>

<p>He was thinking, miserably:</p>

<p>“Next week! Next week! How under heaven can
I get out of this entanglement with honor to myself,
and without scandal to Cora?”</p>

<p>He cried hoarsely, displeasedly, in his uncontrollable
misery:</p>

<p>“Cora, why are you in such a hurry for the wedding?”</p>

<p>He felt the quick start she gave as she leaned
against him, heard the catch in her breath as she
sobbed:</p>

<p>“Oh, you are cruel! Think how often it has been
postponed, and&mdash;and&mdash;I thought that you would be as
impatient as I am! It&mdash;it&mdash;was Aunt Verna who advised
it. She said: ‘Do not keep the poor fellow waiting
long, Cora. No matter if I am sick, the marriage
must not be postponed again! You can be married
very quietly and go away, and no one will think hard
of you, for you have suffered much and waited long!’<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
Oh, Frank, you seem so cold, so indifferent? Do not
tell me you love me no more. If you tore that hope
from me I should die here at your feet of my shame
and my despair!”</p>

<p>No man ever had a tenderer heart than Laurier.</p>

<p>When he heard those passionate words from Cora’s
lips, when he saw the burning tears in her dark eyes,
he felt ashamed and remorseful that he had let his
heart wander from her and fixed it on another.</p>

<p>“Poor girl, she loves me well, and dare I risk the
breaking of my troth to her? She might be driven
to suicide, and her death would lie at my door,” he
thought, in painful indecision that she clearly read with
her keen, feminine intuition.</p>

<p>She drooped sorrowfully before him, her hands
clasped in a mute abandon of despair, as she continued
pathetically:</p>

<p>“If, indeed, you think I am hurrying up the wedding
too much, I can postpone it again, though it would
indeed be evil-omened, a third postponement. But I
wish above all things to please you, my dearest. So
tell me what you wish. Shall it be two weeks hence,
or a month?”</p>

<p>Frank felt like a contemptible wretch and villain, but
he also knew she was weaving a web for him from
which he could not escape, in honor.</p>

<p>“Don’t fret any more, Cora! You need not postpone
it a day longer than you choose. I’m ready any
time you are!”</p>

<p>“Then it shall be next week, as I had planned it,
dearest. Must you go so soon?” as he rose. “Good
night”&mdash;lifting her face for his careless kiss.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">STARTLING NEWS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Jessie Lyndon had been strong enough to send her
lover from her because he was bound to another, but
she was not brave enough to meet him daily in the intimate
association of her mother’s home as she knew
must be the case if she went to Mrs. Dalrymple’s before
the wedding.</p>

<p>She must see him there daily with Cora, and she
knew that her presence would only make him more
unhappy, and hinder the return of his heart to the girl
to whom it was plighted.</p>

<p>Besides, she knew that she was not brave enough,
or strong enough, to bear the pain of seeing him daily
with his betrothed&mdash;perhaps to be compelled by the
narrow conventionalities of society to be a guest at his
wedding.</p>

<p>Fondly as she longed to meet her mother and convey
to her the dying messages of her father, she determined
to postpone that meeting till after Frank
and Cora were married and gone.</p>

<p>Her mind ran over her few humble friends in New
York, suggesting the Widow Doyle as the most available
one with whom to stay during the short interval
that must elapse between now and the marriage. In
this secluded suburban cottage she had no fear that
Frank Laurier could trace her even should he make
an attempt.</p>

<p>So to Widow Doyle she went, and was fortunate to<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
find the good woman at home, receiving a hearty welcome,
and most sincere sympathy, when the sorrowful
tale of her father’s loss was told.</p>

<p>“Poor dear, you will have to stay with me and be
my daughter,” she said, with a tenderness that brought
tears to Jessie’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I will never forget your kindness&mdash;but I have a
relative to whose care I shall go shortly. In the meantime,
I will accept your hospitality most gratefully,”
she cried, not caring to disclose her relationship to
Mrs. Dalrymple until she should have been accepted as
a daughter by the lady.</p>

<p>How could she tell but that the proud, rich lady
might deny her claim, might denounce her as an impostor!</p>

<p>What proof could she offer save her dead father’s
word?</p>

<p>And would that suffice for the proud, rich woman
of whom she had dreamed such beautiful things, but
who might not in any way come up to her ideal mother.</p>

<p>The future looked very gloomy to Jessie as she sat
resting in the little easy-chair in Mrs. Doyle’s sitting
room.</p>

<p>She realized that unless Mrs. Dalrymple accepted
her as a daughter she would be thrown on the world
penniless, and obliged to make her own way.</p>

<p>She had remembered that her father, by a strange
whim, carried the whole of his fortune, consisting
of magnificent uncut gems, in a belt of leather around
his waist.</p>

<p>But she knew that she had a talent that, if exercised,
would provide her a living. It was her voice, whose<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
power and sweetness equaled those of the most world
famous prima donnas. The professors who had cultivated
that charming voice had told her she could secure
a position on the operatic stage any time she chose.</p>

<p>But Jessie cared nothing for fame. At the present
moment, so young, so fair, so tender, all that her heart
craved was love.</p>

<p>And the pain of her disappointment took all the zest
out of life.</p>

<p>She spent a quiet, lonely day with her humble hostess,
whom she entertained by a recital of the way she
had spent her time since leaving New York.</p>

<p>In the evening she grew listless and taciturn, her
mind wandering from this humble abode of the poor
widow to the grand mansion on Fifth Avenue, where
her beautiful, stately mother reigned supreme, and
where Cora was now perhaps receiving Frank and renewing
their vows of love.</p>

<p>“Perhaps when he sees her again his heart will turn
back to her with the old love. How could he help it
when once he loved her so well? He will soon forget
poor Jessie, and that will be the best,” she thought, but
so inconsistent is love that hot tears welled to her eyes
at the fancy.</p>

<p>Then Widow Doyle ran in with the evening paper,
which she had borrowed from a neighbor.</p>

<p>Jessie took it and glanced indifferently at the columns,
thinking that the news of New York had but
little interest for a sad heart like her own.</p>

<p>But presently she found herself quite mistaken, for
her eyes lighted on a paragraph of vital importance to
herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[186]</span></p>

<p>It ran briefly:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mrs. Verna Dalrymple, of No. 1512A Fifth
Avenue, continues very ill with no prospects of recovery.
Indeed, her death is hourly expected. The Four
Hundred will thus lose one of its brightest ornaments,
and the poor of the city one of their most charitable
benefactors. It is a source of regret that so brilliant
and beneficent a life should be thus untimely cut down
in the prime of beauty and intellect.”</p>
</div>

<p>A cruel pain like a sharp thorn pierced Jessie’s
heart as she clutched the newspaper in her rigid hands,
staring at the fatal paragraph with dilated eyes.</p>

<p>She could not stay away from her mother as she
had planned. She must go to her at once and receive
her dying blessing.</p>

<p>Stifling back a choking sob, she rose to her feet, exclaiming
eagerly:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Doyle, I have just read in this paper of the
serious illness of a very dear friend of mine on Fifth
Avenue. If I could get a cab I would go to her at
once.”</p>

<p>“There is a cab stand on the next block. I’ll get
you one at once.”</p>

<p>“Thank you&mdash;God bless you!” Jessie sobbed, and
while the good woman was gone she slipped on her hat
and jacket and stood impatiently waiting, her heart
sinking with fear lest her mother should be dead ere
she reached her side.</p>

<p>The cab arrived speedily, and Mrs. Doyle asked hospitably:</p>

<p>“Shall you return, my dear, to-night?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[187]</span></p>

<p>“It is not likely, but you shall certainly hear from
me to-morrow. Good night, dear, kind friend,” and
with a word of direction to the chauffeur she was
gone.</p>

<p>While Mrs. Doyle was wondering over Jessie’s sudden
departure, there came a hasty knock on the door,
and when she opened it there stood that black sheep of
a stepson of hers that she had not seen for two years&mdash;the
redoubtable Carey Doyle.</p>

<p>Slouching carelessly in, and falling into a seat, he
said amiably:</p>

<p>“How-do, old lady?”</p>

<p>“Well, Carey, this is certainly a day of surprises,
and you’re the second one that has turned up to-day
that I hadn’t seen for two years!” ejaculated the old
lady, in the pleased surprise of one that leads a quiet,
lonely life when confronted with old friends.</p>

<p>“But where have you been all this time? Never
coming near your poor old stepma for two years?” she
added reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Has it been so long? By Jove, I didn’t think it!
But I’ve been hard down to business, and though I
thought of coming often, still I couldn’t spare the
time. But you’ve been getting on all right, have you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve scratched along and kept body and soul
together,” she replied, prudently making the worst of
her situation, lest he had come to borrow money, a
shrewd suspicion, for his face fell as he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Then you haven’t a hundred dollars or so you could
lend a fellow to help him off to the Klondyke?”</p>

<p>“Mercy, no! Where would a poor body like me get<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
a hundred dollars, or even a hundred cents ahead, making
a living by her needle?” she exclaimed, prudently
ignoring a little hoard, Leon Lyndon’s gift to her, that
she had laid by for the future “rainy day” that must
come to all the poor in sickness or trouble.</p>

<p>Doyle looked disappointed and muttered to himself
that he was sorry he had taken the trouble of coming
since he couldn’t wheedle any funds out of the old
woman.</p>

<p>His disappointed gaze roved over the floor and he
saw almost at his feet an exquisitely embroidered
handkerchief. Picking it up, he read aloud the name
in the corner:</p>

<p>“Lisa Chanler!”</p>

<p>“Why, that must be Miss Lyndon’s handkerchief.
She went off in such a hurry she forgot it&mdash;a young
girl that was staying with me, you know,” explanatorily.</p>

<p>Carey Doyle looked up with quick interest, for the
name touched a chord in memory, and brought back
a face that had charmed him with its beauty and enraged
him with its pride.</p>

<p>He remembered that Jessie Lyndon was dead&mdash;that
he had heard a strange story of how she had been
found dead in the snow and acknowledged as the stolen
daughter of a grand, rich woman on Fifth Avenue;
then he had put her out of his thoughts and married
the pawnbroker’s daughter, Yetta Stein, leading a cat-and-dog
existence, quarreling, till a week ago, when he
had left her, swearing that New York was not large
enough to hold them both, and that he would start to
Alaska next day. He meant what he said, and was<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>
raising all the cash he could for the long, perilous journey.</p>

<p>But the name of Lyndon still held a charm for him
that roused his curiosity, making him question his stepmother
about her guest until she told all she knew
about Jessie, from almost two years ago till now.</p>

<p>“And only think of being burned up in the middle
of the ocean! All one’s clothes, I mean&mdash;and escaping
without a rag to one’s back, or a dollar in one’s purse!”
she added vaguely, continuing:</p>

<p>“That fine handkerchief you see was given her by a
Miss Chanler, one of the passengers&mdash;and her other
clothes, too, for, as I said, she hadn’t a rag to her
back, poor girl!”</p>

<p>Carey Doyle was secretly astonished and mystified&mdash;Jessie
Lyndon dead, and Jessie Lyndon living, what
could it mean? He resolved to come back to-morrow
and see the girl for himself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the old family physician came next morning
to see his patient, he was surprised to see her so well.</p>

<p>“Why, how bright you look! You are certainly
better,” he cried gladly.</p>

<p>“I am better, indeed, and it is all owing to such a
pleasant visit I had last evening from an old friend.
It was Frank, and you know how fond I am of him.
Cora brought him in to see me, and he entertained
me so pleasantly that I quite forgot I was almost
dying. Indeed, I am almost resolved now to get well,”
smiling brightly at him.</p>

<p>“Capital! Capital! You only need the will to get
well, and you will soon be in your best health again.<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
I have always told you that, you know, and I am glad
Frank has roused you to take an interest in life again!”
he cried, with hearty joy.</p>

<p>“And he is coming again to-day. I am expecting
him any moment!” Mrs. Dalrymple added, two spots
of feverish color brightening her cheeks in the unrest
of her mind. “There, I hear his voice now! No, doctor,
do not go. He will have strange news for me,
perhaps, and I may need you in my excitement. Besides,
if it is good news I wish you to hear it.”</p>

<p>Frank Laurier entered with Cora, and after salutations
all around, he looked anxiously at the patient,
whispering:</p>

<p>“Can you bear the shock of good news?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Frank, yes, yes&mdash;speak quickly&mdash;my suspense
has been terrible!” she cried hoarsely.</p>

<p>And to the amazement of the doctor and Cora, he
replied: “I obeyed your command, and&mdash;the casket
was empty!”</p>

<p>A shriek of joy broke on their ears, then Mrs. Dalrymple
lay like a corpse before them, so ashen pale, so
deadly still.</p>

<p>The old doctor with a cry of dismay knelt by her
side, and felt for her heart.</p>

<p>“Do not tell me that my good news has killed her!”
Frank cried with horror in his dark-blue eyes, while
Cora awaited the dénouement in wild suspense.</p>

<p>A secret hope came to her that this might be death,
that her aunt might not live to prosecute the search
for her hated rival, Jessie Lyndon.</p>

<p>But presently the old doctor’s efforts at her recovery<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
were rewarded with success. Her eyes opened, the
color came back to her lips, she faltered:</p>

<p>“Ah, you thought that I was dead!&mdash;but how could
I die with such happy news!”</p>

<p>“But I do not understand!” the physician replied
blankly, while Cora remained silent from consuming
rage.</p>

<p>“Tell them all, Frank,” commanded Mrs. Dalrymple,
with a happy smile, and he obeyed in a few
words.</p>

<p>“We had reason to suspect that the young girl, Jessie
Lyndon, whom Mrs. Dalrymple buried as her
daughter almost two years ago, had been resurrected
and was alive in New York, and&mdash;we find that our suspicions
are true.”</p>

<p>“This is startling!” cried the doctor, but Cora listened
silently with a ghastly face and burning eyes.</p>

<p>Frank Laurier continued:</p>

<p>“We know that it is true because I went, by Mrs.
Dalrymple’s request, to her vault in Greenwood this
morning, and opened the casket that we saw closed
on the dead face of her daughter. It was empty.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible?”</p>

<p>“And,” continued Frank, “as if to prove correct the
suspicions of our friend that her divorced husband
had taken away the corpse, I found on the floor a glove
that was marked inside with the name Leon Dalrymple.”</p>

<p>“Ah, it is true, it is true!” cried the invalid faintly,
triumphantly. “My daughter lives! I shall not die
now that I have that happy knowledge. And you will
find her for me, Frank? Every moment is an hour<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
till my Darling is restored to me!” cried the anxious
mother.</p>

<p>“I will do all that is possible,” he answered, but in
her anxiety she made him promise to insert personals
in all the newspapers begging Jessie Lyndon to come
at once to her sick mother, V. D.</p>

<p>Frank’s first effort was to find the chauffeur who
had taken Jessie away from the steamer, but he was
unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Days came and went with no tidings, and then more
personals appeared offering rewards for news of Jessie
Lyndon.</p>

<p>In the meantime, she had never returned to the
Widow Doyle’s humble cot nor sent any message.</p>

<p>But Carey Doyle, watching proceedings with a hawk
eye, chanced upon the personals and ejaculated:</p>

<p>“Come, now, this is very strange. The old lady said
she had gone to see Mrs. Dalrymple, yet apparently
she never got there. Is there foul play anywhere?
Maybe I have stumbled on a private Klondyke of my
own! I’ll claim that reward for news <a id="Ref_192" href="#BRef_192">of</a> her anyway,
but I won’t face Laurier, I’ll go to Mrs. Dalrymple
herself.”</p>

<p>And so eager was the lady for news that he gained
admittance to her boudoir, where she sat in an easy-chair
getting stronger every day, and claiming the reward,
obtained it, and blurted out his news.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dalrymple was terribly startled. She called
out in wild excitement:</p>

<p>“Send Miss Ellyson to me instantly!”</p>

</div>


<p>Cora had been listening outside the door, and she
darted in now, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“I was just coming in when I heard you call for
me, dear aunt.”</p>

<p>She gazed at Carey Doyle as if he had been a perfect
stranger, but her face was ghastly with fear lest
he meant also to betray her secret.</p>

<p>But he flashed her a swift, reassuring look while
Mrs. Dalrymple exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Only think, Cora, this man has news of Darling.
Kindly repeat it to her, sir.”</p>

<p>And Carey Doyle, who remembered well the rivalry
between Cora and Jessie, took a malicious pleasure in
doing so, gloating over each word as he saw how
ghastly pale and frightened she grew.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dalrymple was watching her niece, too, and
very suddenly she said:</p>

<p>“While he was telling me this story, Cora, I remembered
that on that same night a servant called you
out of my room, saying a young lady wanted me, and
that you must come down. You went, and when you
returned, after a while, you said nothing of the visitor,
and in my agitation I forgot it till just now. Cora,
Cora, can it be possible”&mdash;she broke off short, for
Cora fell at her feet in wildest agitation.</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Verna, can you ever forgive me for what
I have done? Indeed, I meant it for the best, but it
has turned out to be a terrible mistake!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[194]</span></p>

<p>“Cora, Cora, what have you done?”</p>

<p>“Forgive me, forgive me; I did wrong.”</p>

<p>“Do not keep me in suspense, Cora. Answer me,
was it my daughter that came that night?”</p>

<p>“It was a girl that looked like the one you interred
in the old family vault. She said: ‘I am Jessie Lyndon,
the stolen daughter of Mrs. Dalrymple. I wish to
see her if you please!’”</p>

<p>“My God! And you sent her away?” groaned the
agonized mother.</p>

<p>“Yes, I sent her away, for how could I dream that
she was speaking the truth?”</p>

<p>“Cora, you should have brought her to me!” wildly.</p>

<p>“I feared it would kill you in your weak state, for
every one thought you were sinking into death. It
seemed to me I was acting very prudently, and when
she was gone I kept the secret, believing it was for the
best.”</p>

<p>Cora’s acting was superb. Her dark eyes were full
of burning tears, and her whole behavior showed grief
and regret.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dalrymple was completely deceived. She almost
pitied Cora.</p>

<p>“Get up, dear girl, do not weep so bitterly. I will
forgive you, for I know you did what you thought was
for the best, though you made a sad and grievous mistake.”</p>

<p>She turned her eyes on Carey Doyle as if she had
momentarily forgotten his presence, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Why, have you not seen the chauffeur who brought
her here?”</p>

<p>“I did not neglect that, madam, but he said she paid<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>
her fare and dismissed him, saying she should remain
with her friends all night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, heavens, what a mystery! Where did my Darling
go, alone, penniless, friendless, that gloomy
night?” sobbed the mother.</p>

<p>Carey Doyle watched Cora with a lynx eye, but her
perfectly acted remorse and grief baffled suspicion.</p>

<p>He rose, and Mrs. Dalrymple said eagerly:</p>

<p>“Keep up the search for my daughter and you shall
be paid well for your work.”</p>

<p>“I will do what I can, madam, and I hope you will
hear from me again,” he replied respectfully; then with
a malignant look at Cora, he withdrew from the room
and was shown out by a servant.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Cora had a difficult rôle to play now, pretending
the keenest regret for her cousin’s disappearance, while
at heart she was wildly elated over it.</p>

<p>But she was not finding much happiness in her position
as bride elect, though she knew that half the girls
in New York would envy her the honor of becoming
the handsome young millionaire’s bride.</p>

<p>They did not know how she had schemed and sinned
for that honor, nor that the sweets of victory had
turned to dead sea fruit upon her lips.</p>

<p>His short-lived passion was dead, and in spite of
his honorable efforts to disguise his indifference, Cora
realized his patient misery, and knew that the day of
their wedding was secretly unwelcome to his heart.</p>

<p>A nobler woman would have given him his freedom
unasked, too proud to accept the hand without the
heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[196]</span></p>

<p>Not so Cora, who recklessly ran every risk for
the sake of gratifying her love and ambition, hurrying
on the wedding day in spite of her aunt’s lingering
illness and painful anxiety, and despite the fact that
she knew that secretly Frank resented the unseemly
haste.</p>

<p>Indeed, she had overheard him lamenting it to Mrs.
Dalrymple, saying:</p>

<p>“I fear it looks selfish to you, our marrying and
going off in such haste, leaving you in this trouble.”</p>

<p>“Do not think of me. Cora is the only one to be
considered now. She feels that she has waited too
long for her happiness to have it postponed longer,”
she answered.</p>

<p>He noticed that she made no reference to his own
case, and flushed slightly, dreading lest she had penetrated
the secret of his love for her missing daughter,
and meant to rebuke him for fickleness to Cora.</p>

<p>He said no more, for Cora entered just then with a
downcast face, having managed to overhear their brief
conversation. They were going for a drive, and presently
Mrs. Dalrymple was left alone with her thoughts.</p>

<p>They were not pleasant ones, for they veered with
painful persistence between the missing daughter and
the dead father.</p>

<p>In the dear, dead past she had loved him well, and
the old love seemed to wake again, now that he was
dead and beyond her tenderness.</p>

<p>She leaned her beautiful, dark head on her wasted,
white hand where the blue veins showed so clearly,
and burning tears flowed down her cheeks.</p>

<p>Suzanne entered with the afternoon mail on a salver,
placed it on a stand before her mistress, and gently
retired.</p>

<p>Dashing away the unwelcome tears, she began going
over the letters, mostly affectionate missives from her
“dear Four Hundred friends,” expressing affectionate
pleasure at her rumored great improvement in health.</p>

<p>Dropping them wearily one after the other, she
came upon one addressed in so large a masculine hand
that she stared at it in some curiosity.</p>

<p>Then she saw that it was not addressed to herself,
but to Miss Darling Dalrymple, and was postmarked
New York.</p>

<p>“How very, very strange this is, and how familiar
the handwriting looks!” she cried with a quickened
heartthrob, and she decided that in this case it was
her duty to open her daughter’s letter.</p>

<p>She did so with nervous, fluttering fingers, and then
she saw staring her in the face these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Darling Daughter</span>: If I had not thought
I was destined to perish in the cruel sea that day, I
should never have given you the clew to find your
proud mother who wrecked my life with her relentless
scorn.</p>

<p>“If I had not been sure of death, I never should<span class="pagenum">[198]</span>
have intrusted you with those messages of remorse
and forgiveness and love at which she laughed, perhaps,
in her undying resentment against me. I could
hope now that you forgot to tell her, for it might be
better so.</p>

<p>“You are with your mother, no doubt, so I address
this letter to her house. Oh, Jessie, darling, how I
blundered when I gave you back to her! My heart
cries out for you, my darling child, the only treasure I
have in the world! I cannot give you up. Will you
come back to me, darling? She has troops of friends,
and does not need you, but I have only my dark-eyed
Jessie.</p>

<p>“If she laughed and mocked at the tender messages
I sent her when I believed I must die, never tell me
of it, darling. I cannot bear the pain.</p>

<p>“Choose between us, quickly, Jessie, and come to me
at once, if you can, at the Hotel Supremacy.</p>

<p class="ir1">“<span class="smcap">Leon Dalrymple.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>The great, hollow, dark eyes devoured every word
with surprise and joy, for nothing he could say
against her mattered much now that she knew he lived,
the man she had loved hopelessly through years of
alienation and separation with the terrible barrier of
divorce between their wedded hearts.</p>

<p>And no matter how far they had drifted apart, their
hearts must share one common sorrow&mdash;the loss of
their darling.</p>

<p>She bowed her head upon the letter, and the wild,
hysterical sobs of an overburdened heart shook her
frame.</p>

<p>Then she seized a pen and wrote falteringly:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Leon, she has never come home to me, so I read
your letter, hoping to find some clew to my lost Darling.</p>

<p>“I have been seeking her vainly for days, but she
is lost to me in this great, wicked city!</p>

<p>“There is much to tell, but I am weak and ill, I cannot
write more. Will you come and hear the story
from my lips?</p>

<p class="center" style="padding-left:7em">“<span class="smcap">Verna.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>Calling a messenger, she dispatched the note to the
Hotel Supremacy, and waited his reply in the wildest
impatience.</p>

<p>Then she bade Suzanne dress her in a becoming
negligee.</p>

<p>“Make me look as young and as well as possible, for
I expect a visit from an old friend who has not seen
me for years&mdash;he will be shocked at the change in me,
I know.”</p>

<p>“Madame is more beautiful still than any young
girl&mdash;only just a little too frail looking now from
recent illness, but judicious dressing will disguise
much of that,” cried the affectionate maid, applying
herself with ardor to her task.</p>

<p>And a little later the result fairly justified her prediction.</p>

<p>The exquisite boudoir in white and gold harmonized<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
well with the delicately beautiful woman whose pallor
was softened by the faint rose hues of her gown overlaid
with rich, creamy laces. Reclining on a pale-hued
divan, with that fitful color coming and going in her
cheek, with a streaming light of expectant joy in her
wide, dark eyes, she was, indeed, a charming picture&mdash;one
to thrill a man’s heart to the core.</p>

<p>“Will he come?” she asked herself in painful uncertainty,
as her mind reverted rapidly over eighteen
years to the bleak November day whereon they had
quarreled and parted.</p>

<p>Oh, how they had loved and hated in a breath, both
so young, so hasty, so inexperienced, that they scarcely
knew what a harvest of woe they were sowing when
they turned their backs on each other.</p>

<p>They had sown, and, alas, they had reaped&mdash;and
the harvest was a plenteous crop of tears that tasted
bitter on their lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[201]</span></p>

<p>She had taken a daring step&mdash;she had called him
back whom in anger she had forsaken years ago.</p>

<p>Now, she began to be frightened at her own boldness.</p>

<p>“He will not come, he will laugh me to scorn!” she
sighed, and dropped her pallid face down on her
arms.</p>

<p>She had given her orders that if a gentleman named
Dalrymple called he should be shown to her boudoir
at once.</p>

<p>With her face bowed on her arms, she did not hear
footsteps falling on the thick velvet carpet, obeying
the low directions of the servant who said respectfully,
as he drew back the portières:</p>

<p>“You will find Mrs. Dalrymple there.”</p>

<p>Leon Dalrymple, tall, pale, handsome still, in spite
of years and sorrow, advanced softly across the room,
his heart beating with loud, suffocating throbs.</p>

<p>He had been thinking of their parting in the shabby
room amid pinching poverty that she despised, more
than eighteen years ago.</p>

<p>Now they were meeting again, surrounded by all the
luxury wealth can bestow, but how valueless it had
been in exchange for what it had cost.</p>

<p>He saw before him a beautiful form with the dark
head bowed on the folded arms as if in grief, and he
stood waiting, hesitating, but she did not look up at
him.</p>

<p>He coughed, timidly, to arouse her, and exclaimed
hoarsely:</p>

<p>“Ver&mdash;Mrs. Dalrymple!”</p>

<p>A start of surprise, and she lifted her pale, excited<span class="pagenum">[202]</span>
face, and saw him standing before her&mdash;her old love,
her discarded husband&mdash;older, graver, sadder by
eighteen long years.</p>

<p>Yet her heart leaped to meet him in a great, strangling
sob of joy.</p>

<p>Without rising from her recumbent position she
held out her hand, saying faintly:</p>

<p>“You will pardon my not rising. I have been ill&mdash;am
yet weak.”</p>

<p>He advanced, and touched the cold hand with his
own that was quite as cold&mdash;dropped it quickly, and
took the seat she indicated close by her divan.</p>

<p>Controlling his emotions as well as he could, he began:</p>

<p>“Your letter filled me with alarm. What can have
happened to my daughter?”</p>

<p>“Our daughter,” she said, gently correcting him,
with a sad smile, adding: “It was very bold in me to
send for you, Leon, but I thought that in this matter
we might act together.”</p>

<p>“Leon”&mdash;she called him Leon as of old&mdash;and it
made the blood rush to his face, and his whole frame
tremble with agitation, the old love rising in him like
a flood.</p>

<p>He answered gravely:</p>

<p>“This is very kind in you.”</p>

<p>And for a moment they were very silent, the novelty
of the position bearing painfully on both their
hearts&mdash;“so near and yet so far.”</p>

<p>Little by little they gained self-possession and talked
seriously on the subject so near to their hearts&mdash;the
mysterious disappearance of their daughter from the<span class="pagenum">[203]</span>
hour when she had been turned away from her mother’s
house by Cora.</p>

<p>She told him all she knew, and he could not conceal
his alarm.</p>

<p>“It is the strangest thing in the world that she did
not return to Mrs. Doyle, the only friend she had in
New York!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The tortured mother bowed her head and wept.</p>

<p>Then Leon Dalrymple’s heart was melted with sympathy,
and he cried:</p>

<p>“Do not weep so bitterly, Verna, I will find her for
you if it is in the power of man to do it. And&mdash;and&mdash;I
will never try to take her from you again. Let
my heart bear all the pangs of loss and loneliness!”</p>

<p>“You have not told me yet how you brought Darling
to life!” she suggested, with a grateful glance.</p>

<p>Then he had to go over the whole story, and she
listened with the closest attention.</p>

<p>Their interview had now lasted more than an hour,
and the ice between them was gradually thawing. The
dark and the blue eyes looked very kindly at each other,
and they were Leon and Verna again in their speech.</p>

<p>She opened the letter, and said daringly, encouraged
by his kindness:</p>

<p>“I am very curious over some things you said in this
letter to Darling. It seems you sent me some messages
of remorse, forgiveness, and love when you
thought you were about to perish. Will you tell me
what they were?”</p>

<p>His face flushed with emotion, but he faltered nervously:</p>

<p>“They would not be welcome to you, Verna.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[204]</span></p>

<p>To his delight she replied, with swimming eyes.</p>

<p>“My heart has been hungry for such words these
eighteen years, Leon&mdash;hungry for the love that I threw
away in my blindness&mdash;hungry for forgiveness that I
dared not ask because I feared denial!”</p>

<p>“My darling!” and he was on his knees by her side,
his arms opening to draw her back to her old shelter
against his heart.</p>

<p>Gladly the dark head nestled there and in an hour
all was explained and forgiven between them while
hope came back to nestle in their hearts.</p>

<p>“We can be married again on the same day as Frank
and Cora,” Mrs. Dalrymple exclaimed happily.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">DEEDS OF KINDNESS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When Dalrymple tore himself away at last to prosecute
the search for his daughter, it occurred to him
to seek her at the home of Mrs. Godfrey, the aunt of
his little nephews, Willie and Mark.</p>

<p>It was a great disappointment to him that she had
heard nothing of Jessie, but after all he had hardly
expected it. A forlorn hope had led him there, coupled
with the desire to see his little nephews.</p>

<p>When the little lads were led in to him their chief
interest in their new-found uncle was that he was the
father of their loved Cousin Jessie. They plied him
with anxious questions about her, to which he could
only answer sadly that she had gone away for a while,
but he hoped she would come back soon.</p>

<p>His first thought was for Mrs. Godfrey, whose care
of his nephews he felt was deserving of a fair reward,
so he presented her with a check for a thousand dollars.</p>

<p>The poor, toil-worn soul was overwhelmed with surprise
and joy.</p>

<p>The sum represented a fortune in her eyes, to which
the grateful tears rushed in torrents.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can never thank you enough! This will be
like riches to my poor sister and me! She can have
the comforts that an incurably sick woman needs now,
thanks to your generosity! But I feel I don’t deserve
it, when I remember how I had to send sweet Jessie
away to earn her own living!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[206]</span></p>

<p>“Do not worry over that, because it could not be
helped. You did more than you were able, taking the
little boys on your hands. I shall take care of them
now and put them to school.”</p>

<p>“They were welcome to all I could do, poor little
ones, and I love them dearly as the children of my dead
brother and his sweet wife, but I am glad you can take
care of them, and bring them up to be something in
the great world,” she replied, with honest pride in her
brother’s children.</p>

<p>“I will do my best,” he replied, bowing himself out,
after promising to return in a day or two and make
arrangements for taking Mark and Willie away.</p>

<p>Then so eager was he for another sight of Verna,
that he must needs call again and tell her about his
nephews and ask her advice about their future.</p>

<p>“I believe I neglected to tell you that I am fairly
rich myself and can afford to do well by the boys without
wronging you or Jessie,” he added.</p>

<p>To his surprise and delight she replied:</p>

<p>“I am almost sorry you are rich, Leon, for I would
like to show you how generous I could be with these
little ones, but they shall be my nephews as well as
yours, and I insist on your bringing them here to-morrow
to make their home with us.”</p>

<p>“My dearest, you do not understand how troublesome
two growing boys could be. Your patience
would very soon be exhausted.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, Leon, for the patter of children’s feet
and the sound of their happy voices would be like
music in this great, lonely mansion. Here we could
care for them like our own children, and how happy it<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>
would make our daughter when she comes home to find
her loved little cousins with us. Let me have my way
in this, Leon, if you can feel satisfied with the arrangements.”</p>

<p>“Satisfied, my own love? Why, it will, indeed, be
a boon to me for which I shall feel grateful to you till
my dying day,” he declared with fervor.</p>

<p>And thus it happened that on the very next day
Mark and Willie Lyndon were removed from the
dreary abode of poverty to their new palatial home.</p>

<p>But the secret rage of Cora Ellyson at the turn affairs
were taking can better be imagined than described.</p>

<p>She had never felt a spark of real love for Mrs.
Dalrymple, and had contemplated her impending death
with inward satisfaction, expecting to inherit all her
money, and rule royally in the social world by reason
of it.</p>

<p>It was a bitter blow when her aunt came back from
the gates of death and began to convalesce, but she
reasoned to herself:</p>

<p>“It is only a temporary improvement in health, for
when her daughter’s fate continues to be unknown she
will relapse into a worse stage than at first, and die
of disappointment.”</p>

<p>But when Mrs. Dalrymple confided to her the new
turn affairs had taken, she could scarcely conceal her
rage.</p>

<p>“You are going to remarry your divorced husband&mdash;the
man you deserted of your own will, Aunt Verna,
and pretended to hate and despise all these years&mdash;Impossible!”
she exclaimed remonstratingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[208]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Dalrymple’s dark head instantly crested itself
with the pride Cora knew so well, and she dared not
find further fault.</p>

<p>So Cora, repulsed, could only vent her rage in secret,
and bitter enough it was, though mixed with one
sweet drop of triumph in the thought that never again
would their eyes rest on Jessie’s sweet face.</p>

<p>“Let them search and search, but never again will
their eyes be gladdened by her return. Let them go
on believing that Cora Ellyson is sorry she sent her
into exile that night. Ha, ha!” and a laugh that was
fiendish in its cruel triumph rang out upon the stillness
of the room. She was in a retrospective mood, and
as she shook loose the braids of dark hair over her
shoulder, she gazed fixedly at her pallid face in the
long mirror, muttering:</p>

<p>“Yet Frank Laurier doesn’t love me. How mortifying
to marry a man who shrinks from one with secret
aversion! Yet I will not turn back. I will marry him
if only to punish him for his perfidy! And if he withholds
love then he shall feel to the core of his heart
what it is to trample on a woman’s love!”</p>

<p>Stung to fury by the indifference he could not hide,
Cora was filled with the venom of “a woman scorned.”</p>

<p>The next day, after fitting out his manly little
nephews in handsome new clothing, Leon Dalrymple
took them to their future home, where they met a cordial<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>
welcome from the woman who was soon to be
their uncle’s wife again.</p>

<p>But not so with Cora, who watched their movements
with angry eyes.</p>

<p>To the little boys, fresh from the tiny cot of poverty,
the great house on Fifth Avenue was a wonderful
Aladdin’s palace.</p>

<p>They gazed about them in round-eyed wonder, and
as soon as the first sense of being company was over
and they were left somewhat to their own devices, they
began to explore the house, peeping into room after
room with childish curiosity, mounting stairway after
stairway, and wandering along broad, dark corridors,
until they could not find their way back to the lower
rooms where they had been left by Mrs. Dalrymple.</p>

<p>“I’m losted,” sobbed Willie, the six-year-old, digging
his little fists into his tearful blue eyes.</p>

<p>“So am I,” cried Mark, who was older and more
manly; “but don’t cry! Here’s another door! Let’s
peep in here!” seizing the knob, and shaking it vigorously.
But the lock refused to yield, and very suddenly
he was caught by Cora Ellyson, who slapped his
face till his ears tingled with pain.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLI">CHAPTER XLI.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">HAPPINESS SUPREME.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Cora’s eyes flashed, her lips and face went ashen
white, her form trembled with passion, as, catching the
boys by their shoulders, she shook both violently,
screaming:</p>

<p>“You little meddlesome wretches, how dare you
sneak around this way, poking your noses into things
that are none of your business! Go away, and if I
ever find either one of you up in this hall again, I will
kill you both!”</p>

<p>The elder boy shook himself loose from her angry
grasp and tried to rescue Willie, saying tearfully:</p>

<p>“We didn’t mean no harm, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Well, keep away from the servants’ hall, hereafter.
Go downstairs now, and never come up here
any more, and mind you never tell any one I slapped
you and shook you just now. If you do I will shut you
up in jail to stay forever!” menaced Cora, with flashing
eyes.</p>

<p>The boys started to go down obediently, Willie
hushing his low sobs in sheer terror, then Cora flew
back to the locked door, opened it with a key that she
took from a little concealed recess, beneath a small
rug that lay before the door.</p>

<p>She did not dream that the curious Mark had darted
back to the head of the stairway, and was closely
watching her movements.</p>

<p>He put his arm around Willie, whispering excitedly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[211]</span></p>

<p>“She has unlocked that room and gone and shut
herself up in it, the mean, spiteful thing! Do you
know I believe she has got something shut up in there.”</p>

<p>“I hate her, and I’m going to tell aunt on her!”
came the sobbed reply.</p>

<p>“No, don’t say nothin’, but let’s watch our chance
to get even with the mean thing by seeing into that
locked door. I seen where she got the key!” consoled
Mark, whose curiosity was a predominating trait.</p>

<p>“Yes,” muttered Willie, hopes of vengeance rising
in his mind. “We’ll get in that room and see what
’tis she’s hiding.”</p>

<p>Then they pattered downstairs again and no one
was the wiser for the little scene that had passed upstairs
in the corridor.</p>

<p>Cora remained in the locked room only a few minutes,
and on leaving it she again turned the key and
slipped it in its place, then sped along the corridor
and down the stairs again to her own rooms with an
evil light in her dark, down-cast eyes that boded no
good to any one who crossed the path of her desires.</p>

<p>The two boys waited and watched for an opportunity
to get up into the servants’ hall again, but such
a close vigil did Cora keep that they were unable to
do so.</p>

<p>At last the wedding day arrived when Cora and
Frank, and Mrs. Dalrymple and her divorced husband,
were to be made one.</p>

<p>On the morning of this day the two brides were very
busy, each in her own apartments were being robed
by their respective maids for the noon ceremony&mdash;Cora
in a handsome traveling gown and hat to go away immediately,<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
and her aunt in a dainty confection of blue
brocade and rich lace for an informal luncheon with
the few wedding guests.</p>

<p>Love and hope beat high in the breasts of both&mdash;the
girl who had played such high stakes to gain a
man’s heart, the woman who had never known the
value of love till it was lost and found again.</p>

<p>The drawing-room and corridors were gracefully
but not too lavishly decorated for the ceremony with
stately palms and rich roses, whose fragrance filled the
air with sweetness.</p>

<p>Little Mark and Willie were not watched so closely,
and roved hither and thither about the great house,
whispering to each other, and, truth to tell, feeling
almost too grand in the fine suits of velvet with rich
lace collars that had been put upon them to grace the
occasion. Being left somewhat to their own devices
in the prevailing excitement, they naturally turned at
once to the locked room on the upper floor.</p>

<p>“We must do it now or never, because she is going
off with that Mr. Laurier as soon as she is married,
to stay a long while,” said Mark.</p>

<p>“Yes, we must. Let’s go now.” And they stole unseen
upstairs and Mark soon found the key beneath
the rug. But it was so large, and the lock so strong
that when they got it in they could not turn it.</p>

<p>“Put your ear to the keyhole and listen. Don’t
you hear something?” said Mark.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;sounds like a little kitty cryin’; pore li’l
sing!” whimpered Willie.</p>

<p>It lacked only fifteen minutes to the ceremony now.
The two bridegrooms with the guests and the bishop<span class="pagenum">[213]</span>
had arrived and were waiting downstairs. Everything
was in readiness for the hour.</p>

<p>The few wedding guests whispered to each other
when Cora entered that she was the palest, most
frightened-looking bride they had ever seen. What
was it that could be preying upon her mind upon such
an occasion as this?</p>

<p>But, they added kindly enough, that it was no wonder,
for after her two former fateful wedding days
who could blame her for being nervous and apprehensive
of disaster.</p>

<p>She came in quietly enough, with downcast eyes,
with her aunt, for the wedding was to be quite informal,
the ceremony being performed first for the
elder couple.</p>

<p>Frank Laurier was there looking quite as pale and
troubled as his bride, but again the guests excused
his perturbation, whispering:</p>

<p>“He is afraid something is going to happen.”</p>

<p>A sort of undefined dread of evil pervaded the air.</p>

<p>The bishop arose and opened his book as the elder
couple moved in front of him, and the happiness on
those two fine faces, the chastened happiness of reunion
after long grief and pain&mdash;almost dissipated
the lowering cloud of presentiment over every spirit.</p>

<p>Brief questions were asked, clear responses made,
and the ring slipped over the bride’s slender finger,
token of a union never to be broken “until death do us
part.”</p>

<p>Kisses, congratulations, tears, and smiles, for the
happy pair, then they moved aside for the others with
a prayer in their hearts that these two might not sail<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
forth upon such stormy seas of matrimonial disaster
as they had done in ignorant youth.</p>

<p>None had noticed in the excitement of the congratulations
that three more guests had arrived&mdash;three men
who had bribed the servants to let them look on at
the scene from behind the tall palms at the open door
of the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Pale, grave, silent, these three men watched the
scene with eager eyes, as Frank and Cora stood side
by side breathing the words that bound their lives in
one forever.</p>

<p>Suddenly one gasped and started wildly forward
as the minister repeated mechanically the customary
warning, for any one who knew any impediment to the
marriage to speak now or forever after hold his peace.</p>

<p>This man, tall, pale, with a sinister scar on his brow,
and a painful limp, crossed the room as swiftly as his
infirmity would permit, and thundered:</p>

<p>“I forbid the marriage. She is my wife!”</p>

<p>The bishop dropped his prayer book in amazement,
and with startled cries, all faced around upon the newcomer.</p>

<p>Cries of doubtful recognition shrilled over every
lip:</p>

<p>“Ernest Noel!”</p>

<p>Cora clung with frantic hands to Frank’s arm, gazing
with horrified eyes at the daring intruder.</p>

<p>There stood Ernest Noel in the flesh, though his
good looks were marred by a scar on his cheek and a
decided limp received in some accident. Over one of
his shoulders peered the grave, noble face of the minister
who had married them in the mock marriage<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
that had turned out a real one, and over the other she
saw, like a grinning fiend’s, Carey Doyle’s with an ugly
sneer on the mustached lips.</p>

<p>She was dizzy and her brain reeled. She felt like a
weak swimmer in a strong sea swept away by the relentless
and treacherous undertow.</p>

<p>In the momentary silence that followed their cries
of recognition, Ernest Noel continued earnestly:</p>

<p>“This lady is my wife, but I do not charge her with
attempted bigamy. She believed me dead.”</p>

<p>“Explain!” thundered Frank Laurier, thrilled with
chivalrous pity for the drooping figure that clutched
his arm with frantic hands.</p>

<p>Ernest Noel bowed gravely, and said:</p>

<p>“Two years ago I was frantic with love for Miss
Ellyson and tried to win her from you, Frank Laurier.
We two were the principals in a mock marriage
at some charitable affair, and in my desperation I
made the ceremony a real one, taking out the necessary
license and securing a young minister, Mr. Kincaid,
to officiate. Some time afterward I ventured to
confess to my bride the imposition I had practiced on
her and was met by such indignant reproaches that I
was driven to&mdash;suicide!</p>

<p>“Disappointed in my love, I sprang into a deep pit
to end my life, but the fall did not kill me. I lingered
on in agony till the next day, when this man with me,
Carey Doyle, discovered and rescued me from my
perilous situation, taking me to the home of some
country friends of his, where I was cared for many
months ere fully restored to myself.</p>

<p>“It was rumored that I had mysteriously disappeared,<span class="pagenum">[216]</span>
and the report of my suicide was accepted as
correct. Carey Doyle, for the sake of a whim, kept the
secret of my identity, and so for many months I remained
as one dead to the world that formerly knew
me; while regaining my consciousness at last I learned
that Cora had been almost fatally burned and would be
the inmate of a hospital perhaps for years. In despair
I forswore all former associations, and no one but the
executors of my property were informed of my continued
existence, while I brooded miserably over my
faults and the wreck I had made of my own life, my
selfish passion and reckless folly. I determined never
to return to the world, but this morning Carey Doyle
came to tell me that I must save Cora from bigamy by
forbidding her contemplated marriage with another.”</p>

<p>Cora and Doyle at that moment exchanged malevolent
glances, and she understood all.</p>

<p>In the beginning the wretch had concealed the fact
of Noel’s continued existence that he might more effectually
pursue his scheme of blackmail.</p>

<p>But again she looked from his taunting face back
to the grave, sad face of Noel, who now added:</p>

<p>“I am here to say to Cora and you all, that my marriage
to her was perfectly legal as far as church and
State could make it. I love her still in spite of everything,
and if she will forgive me the wrong I did in
making her my wife against her will, and wishes to go
with me, I on my part will forgive any harm she ever
did me and gladly take her to my heart. On the other
hand, if she prefers to secure a divorce and marry Laurier,
I will make no fight against it. Her will shall be
my law!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[217]</span></p>

<p>It was a most noble rôle the man was playing in concealing
Cora’s sins and taking them all on his own
broad shoulders.</p>

<p>He had bought Carey Doyle’s silence, and was prepared
to keep Cora’s secret forever from the world in
atonement for the one great wrong he had done her&mdash;the
wrong to which she had tempted him by her
heartless coquetry.</p>

<p>Forgiving all her sins by the strength of his love
he hoped to win her yet from Laurier, and awaited her
answer with burning impatience.</p>

<p>But she clung all the closer to Frank, though she
could read by his face that he thought she ought to
turn to Noel.</p>

<p>She was opening her lips to cry out passionately
that she loved only Laurier and would sue for a divorce,
when Mark and Willie Lyndon rushed upon the
scene, panting and excited, crying breathlessly:</p>

<p>“Oh, Uncle Leon, Aunt Verna, come with us! We
have found our dear Cousin Jessie at last, but she is
dead!”</p>

<p>Like a flash in the confusion of that startling announcement,
Cora dropped Frank’s arm and flew to
Noel’s side:</p>

<p>Her face was ghastly as she breathed in his ear:</p>

<p>“Come, Ernest, the machine is waiting! Let us fly!
Fly to the other end of the world!”</p>

<p>Half dazed with the suddenness of the turn things
were taking, he followed her lead, and while the
others rushed upstairs, he and Cora sprang into the
limousine and were driven to the railway station.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[218]</span></p>

<p>The secret of the locked room was no longer a
secret.</p>

<p>A score of people followed the eager footsteps of
the little lads upstairs to the sad sight they had encountered
on opening the door.</p>

<p>There lay sweet Jessie, wan, pale, terribly emaciated,
and still as death on the low couch&mdash;a sight that
brought cries of grief and horror from women’s lips,
and tears to the eyes of men.</p>

<p>Fortunately the old family physician was in the company.</p>

<p>It looked like death, but he would not pronounce it
so. He remembered what a terrible mistake he had
made over Jessie before.</p>

<p>He knelt by her side, doing all he could to restore
life, and all the while he was inwardly praying:</p>

<p>“God help me! Give back her beautiful life to us!”</p>

<p>And all the time the anguished mother and father,
the distracted lover, the interested friends, were echoing
the prayer in their hearts.</p>

<p>Oh, what joy thrilled their hearts when the doctor
found a faint little sign of life, but what long and
skillful nursing it took before Jessie was well again,
or even strong enough to tell the story of Cora’s satanic
cruelty!</p>

<p>But they were happy days when she was convalescing
with so many dear ones by her side&mdash;her reunited
parents, her precious little cousins, and last but not
least, her devoted lover, Frank Laurier.</p>

<p>They did not hide their love from each other now,
they could talk of the past without embarrassment,
and once when Darling Jessie, as they called her now,<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>
scolded him for that first stolen kiss, he retorted by
telling her of that second kiss upon the sea that had
seemingly brought her back to life.</p>

<p>They had many things to tell her, but the story
that interested her most of all was of her own apparent
death and her interment in the old family vault.</p>

<p>She knew now that it was no dream, the memories
she had cherished of her mother’s sorrow over her
coffin, and Frank Laurier’s words of passionate love
and grief. She would cherish them deep in her heart
forever.</p>

<p>As for Mark and Willie, they received the most
idolatrous love from all.</p>

<p>“It was so noble in you, Verna, to take them to our
own home so generously that I was always thinking
what I could do to reward you for your goodness,
but, lo! God paid the debt of gratitude by making the
little lads the saviors of our own daughter,” the fond
husband cried, with deep emotion.</p>

<p>In the following spring Ernest Noel wrote to Mrs.
Dalrymple telling her of Cora’s death at his villa in
Italy.</p>

<p>Shortly after the announcement of this sad news
Frank Laurier and the girl he loved were united in
the holy bands of matrimony.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">IRIS AND ISABEL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“What do you mean by disobeying my orders?
Didn’t I tell you I would see no one to-night? How
dare you take it upon yourself to act contrary to my
wishes?”</p>

<p>Peter, the servant, to whom these angry, impatient
words were addressed, stood meekly in the doorway
of his master’s library, half in and half out of the
room, waiting for Mr. Oscar Hilton’s loud voice to
cease before venturing to explain his reason for thus
intruding on the latter’s privacy.</p>

<p>“Please, sir, I didn’t forget your orders, but if you’ll
remember, sir, you told me only yesterday never to
deny you to Mr. St. John&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>As Peter uttered this name Oscar Hilton’s face,
which had been haggard and pale as if some deep sorrow
weighed upon him, brightened wonderfully, and
his voice lost its angry tone.</p>

<p>“You are right, Peter; say to Mr. St. John that I
will see him here, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>At this moment Peter drew himself back from the
doorway, and a young girl entered the room&mdash;a petite
and fairylike creature, looking even younger than her
eighteen years, with eyes of that peculiar blue that
darkens into purple, a complexion clear and fair as the
lotus leaf, and hair of a deep reddish brown that shone
like dull gold in the soft shaded light.</p>

<p>She was dressed richly, as became the daughter of
Oscar Hilton&mdash;who was supposed to be one of the<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
richest men in New York. But that gentleman’s face
betrayed neither admiration nor love as she advanced
into the room and stood before him.</p>

<p>“We are ready for Mrs. Laurier’s reception, papa,
and I wanted you to see my costume for the occasion
before Isabel came to you, because I knew how my
poor little self will fade into insignificance and be
totally eclipsed by the superior beauty of my queenly
sister&mdash;but what is the matter? Papa, you look pale
and tired. Shall I stay at home and read for you?
Indeed, I do not care about the party&mdash;do let me stay
with you, papa.”</p>

<p>The girl’s sweet voice&mdash;at first full of playfulness
and merriment&mdash;had grown tender and earnest with
the utterance of the last words, and she came toward
her father with hands extended as if to embrace him;
but Oscar Hilton repulsed her almost rudely.</p>

<p>“Go to the reception by all means, Iris, and don’t be
so silly and childish. I am expecting a visitor just
now, and cannot be bothered. Say to Isabel that I
will see her when she comes back from Mrs. Laurier’s.
I have writing to do to-night, and shall not have retired.”</p>

<p>Iris Hilton bowed, and turned from her father without
a word, but the sweet, girlish face had lost all its
look of brightness, and the pretty lips quivered piteously
while she went to do his bidding.</p>

<p>Mr. Hilton seemed to breathe more freely when she
was gone, and it would have been hard to fathom the
expression of his eyes as he followed the graceful little
figure in its retreat from the room, muttering below
his breath:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[222]</span></p>

<p>“Her ‘queenly sister,’ she called my dark-eyed Isabel.
Ah, God! how easily I could bear the ruin that
threatens me, and the disgrace that must inevitably
follow, if my Isabel were provided for, my proud,
imperious darling.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hilton’s meditations were here interrupted by
the entrance of his visitor, Mr. Chester St. John, a
handsome, distinguished-looking man of thirty years,
whose easy, graceful bearing and cultured manner
proclaimed him at once a gentleman in the truest
sense of the word.</p>

<p>Mr. Hilton received him with every token of welcome,
and St. John entered at once into the object
of his visit.</p>

<p>“I think you must have guessed long ago, Mr.
Hilton,” he said, when cozily seated with that gentleman
before a bright grate fire in the luxuriously furnished
library, “that I love your beautiful daughter
with all my heart. I have not spoken to her of
this love, as yet, but I think&mdash;I have dared to hope,
that she reciprocates my feeling, and I only await
your permission to ask her to make me the happiest
of men.”</p>

<p>St. John paused here, waiting for Mr. Hilton’s answer.</p>

<p>It was so long before the latter made any reply to
Chester’s proposal that the young man began to fear
he had received it unfavorably.</p>

<p>“Is it possible that you have other views for your
daughter, Mr. Hilton?” he asked, somewhat proudly,
but with a tremor of real anxiety in his deep-toned
voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[223]</span></p>

<p>“No, no, my dear boy, you are the one man of all
others to whom I could think for a moment of giving
my precious child. I feel&mdash;nay! I know that you are
worthy of her, and I will not stand between her and
her love.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, my dear sir, and I assure you you shall
never have cause to regret the confidence you have
placed in me. It shall be the labor of my life to make
Iris happy&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Iris!”</p>

<p>At Chester St. John’s mention of this name Oscar
Hilton sprang to his feet, with every trace of color
dying out of his face, and his hands pressed tightly
to his heart.</p>

<p>“Iris!” he again ejaculated hoarsely; but when
Chester sprang to his side in alarm he waved him
back authoritatively. “It is nothing,” he cried, with
quick, gasping breaths, “I am subject to these sudden
spasms of pain&mdash;around my heart&mdash;and it is so natural
for me to call on&mdash;Iris&mdash;there! it is over now,
but I would like to be alone. Come to-morrow, St.
John, and Iris will give you her answer.”</p>

<p>Chester was not in the least offended by this abrupt
dismissal, having no suspicion that the pain of which
Mr. Hilton had complained was purely imaginary, and
that there was a deeper cause for that ashen, pale face
and those trembling hands.</p>

<p>He bade Iris’ father good night with many expressions
of regret, promising to call for Iris’ answer on
the morrow, and taking his departure at last with
such a look of hope upon his face that one might
have guessed what he expected the girl’s answer to be.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE OUTCAST.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Iris! Iris! My God, have I killed her?”</p>

<p>The words came from the lips of Oscar Hilton with
a cry of unutterable fear, as he bent over the rigid
and senseless form of his young daughter, on the
morning following his interview with Chester St. John.</p>

<p>“I have killed her!” the man reiterated; but even
as he lifted the girl’s head from the floor, her lips
trembled slightly, and the lids were lifted slowly from
the beautiful blue eyes that looked purple now, as Iris
awakened to the consciousness of a sorrow tenfold
more bitter than death.</p>

<p>“It cannot&mdash;oh, it cannot be true!” she moaned,
drawing herself away from the touch of his hands
with an irrepressible shudder.</p>

<p>“You say that Chester St. John loves me, and will
ask me to be his wife, and I&mdash;loving him with every
pulse of my heart&mdash;must give him up. Nay! more&mdash;that
I must tell him I have no love for him&mdash;must send
him from me with the bitter thought that I am a false
and heartless coquette. No! no! Oh, dear Heaven!
I can do anything but that.”</p>

<p>Oscar Hilton had been terrified when it seemed to
him that Iris lay dead at his feet, but at the moment
when her voice fell again upon his ear, his voice grew
stern and cold, and he spoke to her now with a sneer.</p>

<p>“Do you think Chester St. John would ask you to
be his wife if he knew the true story of your life?<span class="pagenum">[225]</span>
He is very proud of his fine old name; do you think
he would care to give it to the child of a&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The word he would have spoken died on his lips
unuttered, for Iris had lifted her eyes quickly to his
own, with an intangible something in their expression
that daunted him.</p>

<p>“You have told me the story of my parentage, Mr.
Hilton, and if you have any claim to the title of a
gentleman, you will not insult my helplessness by repeating
the epithet you were about to apply to me.
When you married my father’s divorced wife, and
took her to be a mother to your daughter Isabel, why
did you allow her to rear me&mdash;that man’s offspring&mdash;as
one entitled to your name, to crush me at this late
day with a knowledge of the truth. It has pained me
always to notice your coldness toward me, in contrast
to your passionate love for Isabel; but I&mdash;I never suspected
this. Oh, how could my own mother deceive
me so?”</p>

<p>“I should never have told you the truth, Iris, but
for this affair with St. John. I have treated you
always as my own child, and denied you no luxury
that Isabel herself has enjoyed. If I now demand a
sacrifice at your hands, I think I have a right to expect
that you will grant what I ask. At a word from me
your mother would have given you, an infant of two
years, into an asylum, sixteen years ago. I saved you
from such a fate, and all I ask in return is that you
will cure Chester St. John of his infatuation for
your pretty, childish face. It is nothing more than
infatuation, for before your return from school he
was devoted to Isabel; and, Iris, I will tell you this<span class="pagenum">[226]</span>
in strict confidence: unless my daughter makes an advantageous
marriage very soon, I shall be a ruined
man. Think what this word ruin means, not only to
Isabel, but to your invalid mother, whose love of ease
and luxury is part of her very life. Make St. John
believe that you have no love for him, and all will be
well, I know. The secret I have revealed to you to-day
shall never again pass my lips, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Let me speak!” interrupted Iris, with quick, panting
breaths. “I have no other way of paying you for
what you have done for me, and I&mdash;I will do what
you ask. But when I have sent Chester St. John from
me I shall leave your home forever. I will never pass
another night beneath your roof.”</p>

<p>A low knock on the door at this moment interrupted
the girl’s brave words, and Peter entered, to announce
that Mr. St. John was waiting in the parlor to see
Miss Iris.</p>

<p>“So soon! Oh, how shall I meet him?” exclaimed
Iris, with such a passionate cry of pain that Mr.
Hilton feared her resolution would fail at the last, and,
starting toward her, attempted to take one of her
hands in his own.</p>

<p>“Iris, do not forget,” he began, but she drew herself
shudderingly away from him, saying, as she moved
slowly toward the door:</p>

<p>“I shall not forget the debt I owe you; I am going
to pay it now&mdash;to pay it in full.”</p>

<p>There was no tremor in the low, sweet voice as she
spoke these words, but her face, turned for a moment
toward him as she crossed the threshold, was so pitifully
white and hopeless that a momentary thrill of<span class="pagenum">[227]</span>
compassion stirred Oscar Hilton’s heart, and he muttered
to himself as he listened to the sound of her footsteps
descending the stairs:</p>

<p>“Pshaw! she does not mean all that nonsense. I
would never let her do that, but she shall not stand
in my Isabel’s light. Ah, my daughter! I was thinking
of you; was I speaking my thoughts aloud?”</p>

<p>He had spoken the last words audibly, just as the
object of his thoughts entered the room.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, papa? I just passed Iris in
the hall, looking like a ghost, and came in here to
find you raving about somebody standing in my light.
Tell me what it is all about, please; I hate anything
approaching a mystery.”</p>

<p>Isabel spoke in the cold, imperious tones that were
peculiar to her, but her father answered her almost
humbly:</p>

<p>“There is no mystery, my darling; do not distress
yourself. Don’t go yet, Isabel, I want to talk with
you. You have not told me how you enjoyed yourself
at Mrs. Laurier’s last night. Were there many
there? Was Mr. St. John among the guests at any
time during the evening?”</p>

<p>The last question was asked so earnestly that Isabel
showed her white teeth in a laugh.</p>

<p>“You are always so anxious about Chester St. John,
papa; I think you have set your heart upon having
him for a son-in-law; is it not so, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon père</i>
?”</p>

<p>Mr. Hilton answered his daughter gravely:</p>

<p>“I would like it of all things, Isabel; I should like
to see you Chester St. John’s wife.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[228]</span></p>

<p>Isabel’s dark, handsome face flushed, and she spoke
somewhat bitterly:</p>

<p>“I would consent to be his wife if he asked me,
papa, because he is the richest man I know, and the
handsomest; but I do not like him. I think him proud,
scornful, and sarcastic; and if the day ever comes
when I&mdash;but I must not make idle threats; take comfort
in the thought, my father, your dutiful daughter
will employ every art in her power to bring Chester
St. John to her feet.”</p>

</div>


<p>Chester St. John, waiting rather impatiently for the
appearance of Iris in the parlor, came forward with
warm words of greeting to meet the little white-robed
figure, when the girl at last made her appearance, failing,
in the semidarkness of the room, to notice the
unusual pallor of her face, or the strange constraint
of her manner.</p>

<p>“Iris!”</p>

<p>He could only speak the two soft, sweet syllables
of her name, thinking how well it suited her&mdash;Iris&mdash;like
a rainbow, always bright.</p>

<p>He tried to take her hands in his own, for&mdash;although
he had as yet made no actual declaration of
his love, he knew he had shown her in many ways
how dear she was to him, and if he was not mistaken
in the language of her sweet, beautiful eyes, he felt
equally confident that his love was returned.</p>

<p>It was not until her hand lay in his own, and he
felt it cold as ice in his clasp, that he took the alarm.</p>

<p>“Iris, my beloved! You know why I have come to
you this morning; your father has told you&mdash;&mdash;” he
began, and then&mdash;drawing her closely in his arms he
looked intently in her face, uttering a low cry of alarm
at sight of the white, changed countenance. “Iris!
Oh, my love, what is it? What pain or sorrow has
come to you?” he exclaimed, bending his lips to hers,
while for one moment she lay white and passive in<span class="pagenum">[230]</span>
his embrace. “Speak to me, my little one! My wife!”
he ejaculated. But at the sound of those words, “My
wife!” Iris drew herself out of his embrace, shivering
from head to foot, and covering her ears to shut out
the sound of the voice whose every accent was sweeter
than any earthly music to her.</p>

<p>“You must not talk to me so. You have no right
to address me in such terms,” she said in a voice that
sounded cold and feelingless from the very effort she
was making to control her emotion. “I cannot be your
wife, Mr. St. John. I&mdash;I do not love you. You have
been mistaken; please do not distress me by repeating
your offer.”</p>

<p>It was such a cold and careless rejection that Chester
St. John could not at first believe the evidence of
his own ears.</p>

<p>What transpired during the next few minutes Iris
could never clearly recall. She had a vague memory
of hearing a voice that bore no resemblance to the
clear tones of Chester St. John, upbraiding her in
bitter, heartbreaking terms for making his life desolate,
and destroying his faith in his mother’s sex.</p>

<p>She seemed to feel for days and weeks afterward
the close, almost cruel, pressure of his hand as he
held her fingers for one moment in parting; after
which it had seemed to her that the earth grew suddenly
dark and cold as the grave, and for the second
time, since listening to Oscar Hilton’s story in the library,
she had fallen like one dead.</p>

</div>


<p>“Jenny, how much longer must you work to-night?
It is so tiresome, lying here alone, with no one to
speak to me; won’t you put aside your sewing, dear,
and read for me?”</p>

<p>It was a woman’s voice, weak and fretful, that uttered
these words, and the person to whom they were
addressed, a pale, weary-looking girl of twenty years,
put aside the handsome silk robe upon which she had
been sewing, and came to the bedside of the invalid.</p>

<p>“I must work a little longer, mother, dear,” she
said softly. “Miss Hilton will be so angry about her
dress; you know I promised it for last night, and
failed to have it done, because of that unfortunate
headache; but what is the matter, mother&mdash;are you
feeling worse? Oh, my mother! I seem to see you
failing, hour by hour.”</p>

<p>Jenny had broken into a passionate fit of weeping,
kneeling by the low cot bed with her face on her
mother’s breast.</p>

<p>“Hush! hush! my dear, poor child; you have been
so brave always, and so patient with my fretful ways;
don’t give way now, dear; try to prepare yourself&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Jenny’s hand was pressed upon her lips now, and
she could not finish the sentence.</p>

<p>“You shall not talk of leaving me,” the girl cried
passionately; adding in tones of wild rebellion against
the fate she had no power to avert, “God would not
be so cruel to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[232]</span></p>

<p>At this moment there was a crash of thunder that
seemed to shake the tall tenement to its foundation,
and the mother and daughter clung to each other almost
in terror, the storm had arisen so suddenly.</p>

<p>It was the evening of the day on which Oscar Hilton
had told Iris the story of her true parentage.</p>

<p>“How nervous I am to-night, mother. Let me close
the window blinds, the rain is coming in through the
broken pane, and if a drop should fall on Miss Hilton’s
dress she would never forgive me. If it was
her sister, Miss Iris, I should not be afraid.”</p>

<p>Jenny’s voice ceased suddenly, for at this moment
there was a low knock on the door.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! Oh, dear! I fear this is Miss Hilton’s
servant for the dress,” murmured the little seamstress,
as she hastened to admit the visitor; but the look
of distress on her face changed to one of intense astonishment
as she saw who it was that waited to
be admitted.</p>

<p>“Miss Iris!” she could only ejaculate; and Iris came
slowly into the room, seating herself on the nearest
chair, like one who was very weary, while Jenny hastened
to light a lamp, as the room was growing quite
dark.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Iris!” she cried in alarm, when her eyes
first fell upon the changed countenance of the young
lady, “you are in trouble; what can I do for you? I
know I am only a poor sewing girl, and you a rich
man’s daughter, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Until now Iris had been unable to speak, but here
she interrupted:</p>

<p>“Listen to me, Jenny: I have come to you to-night<span class="pagenum">[233]</span>
as poor and humble as yourself. You must not ask
me to tell you all my story, but this you must know.
I am no longer Iris Hilton, the rich man’s daughter;
I must earn my bread even as you earn yours, by
the labor of my hands. You have seemed so grateful
for what little help I rendered you that I came to
you to-night as to a friend&mdash;there, don’t cry, Jenny&mdash;I
cannot cry; I do not feel as if I could ever shed a
tear again. I would have gone to my friend Mrs.
Laurier, but I could not. I am no longer in her social
set, not that that would make any difference to her,
but I simply could not take advantage of her friendship.”</p>

<p>There was something so unutterably sorrowful in
the tone in which these words were spoken that both
Jenny and the sick mother shed tears of sympathy,
and the sound of the latter’s low sobbing had the effect
of rousing Iris from the bitter train of thought into
which she had fallen.</p>

<p>“Forgive me,” she said, in her sweet, gentle voice,
as she approached the bedside and clasped the hand of
the invalid. “I have been selfish to intrude my sorrows
on you, but you shall see how cheerful I will
be after to-night, for I am going to stay with you,
if you will have me, and Jenny shall show me how to
sew.”</p>

<p>The sound of footsteps approaching the door, followed
by an imperative knock, interrupted Iris at this
moment, and she had just time to seat herself when
Jenny opened the door, to admit a gentleman, the first
sight of whose face caused Iris to start and clasp her
hands together in sudden excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[234]</span></p>

<p>“The face in my mother’s locket!” she said to herself,
and shivered when the man’s voice fell on her
ear, although he was speaking merely on some trivial
business matter that did not in the least concern her.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Neville requested me to remind you that she
expects her dress to be completed before one o’clock
to-morrow,” he was saying to Jenny, and in a moment
more he would have left the room without glancing
toward the spot where Iris was sitting but for some
slight sound that caused him to turn in the doorway.
He started at the sight of Iris’ face, even as Iris had
done on first encountering his own, and Iris could hear
the swift-spoken words he whispered to Jenny:</p>

<p>“Introduce me to that young lady; she is very like
a&mdash;a friend I lost years ago.”</p>

<p>Jenny turned toward Iris with the words of introduction
trembling on her lips, but Iris checked her by
a glance, as she herself stepped forward.</p>

<p>“My name is Maggie Gordon, sir; I am a seamstress,
like my friend.”</p>

<p>The abruptness of this singular introduction seemed
to take the man completely by surprise, and he could
only bow low in acknowledgment and hasten from the
room, leaving Iris&mdash;or Maggie Gordon, as our heroine
had called herself&mdash;white and trembling like one who
had stood in the presence of some spirit of darkness.</p>

<p>“I am afraid! Oh, so horribly afraid,” she whispered,
and crouched by the sick woman’s bedside, hiding
her face in the bedclothes, and trembling in every
limb.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE UNFORGOTTEN FACE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“I called to see your dressmaker this evening, Clara,
and she promises to have your work completed to-morrow,
without fail, and&mdash;but by the way, my dear,
I am not quite certain that the young girl will be able
to keep her promise. I caught a glimpse of her invalid
mother, and it is my belief that the poor woman
will not live till morning. I suppose, in that case,
the other young lady will be obliged to finish the work
for you.”</p>

<p>The speaker was Mr. Charles Broughton, and the
woman he addressed Mrs. Clara Neville, a haughty,
handsome widow of thirty, and Mr. Broughton’s affianced
wife.</p>

<p>The fair widow would never have owned to herself
that she could harbor the slightest feeling of
jealousy toward such an insignificant personage as a
dressmaker’s associate; but there was something in
Mr. Broughton’s expression and manner of speaking
of that other lady that brought an angry glitter to the
black eyes of his betrothed.</p>

<p>“Who is the person you are speaking of? I never
had the pleasure of meeting any other sewing woman
in Jenny’s home. I have always understood that Jenny
Mason was without friends or connections in this
country.”</p>

<p>“I saw a face in Jenny Mason’s home to-night that
brought back&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[236]</span></p>

<p>He did not finish the sentence, but threw his hands
suddenly over his face, shivering in the warmth and
luxury of the cozy apartment in which he sat, as if
he had been facing a wintry blast.</p>

<p>“Let me finish the sentence for you, Mr. Broughton;
the face you saw to-night brought back the memory
of some woman you have loved in the past. What
a pity that the possessor of this face should be only a
working girl.”</p>

<p>“By heavens! you wrong me, Clara,” he cried
hoarsely, “the girl I saw to-night reminded me of my
bitterest enemy&mdash;of a woman I have cause to hate&mdash;and
whose name I curse every hour of my life. If I
thought one drop of that woman’s blood flowed in the
veins of this working girl I would hunt her out of
every place she found employment. I would never
rest until I had visited the sin of her&mdash;but what wild
talk is this? The woman whose name I curse is living
in luxury wherever she may be, and the poor little
seamstress is not to blame for her remarkable resemblance
to one who must be a stranger to her. Never
send me there again, Clara; the sight of that girl’s
face aroused all the demon within me, and awakened
passions that have lain dormant for years.”</p>

<p>He was a handsome man, despite his five-and-forty
years. His thick, wavy black hair showed no thread
of silver, and his eyes were keen and bright.</p>

<p>He was a general favorite among the fair sex, although
but little was known of his antecedents or
former history.</p>

<p>If there was an air of mystery surrounding him,
this fact only tended to make him more interesting<span class="pagenum">[237]</span>
in the eyes of the ladies, and there were many who
envied Clara Neville her conquest when it became
known that this fascinating little widow had won
handsome Charley Broughton’s love.</p>

<p>Clara herself was very proud of her stately, distinguished-looking
lover, and insanely jealous of him,
as her recent exhibition of temper may have led the
reader to suppose.</p>

<p>She was half frightened now at the storm of passion
her own words had evoked, but she had no longer
any fear that he admired the girl he had met at Jenny
Mason’s.</p>

<p>“Pray calm yourself, my dear Charles,” she said;
“you shall never go to my dressmaker’s again; you
will surely be ill if you excite yourself so; I shall be
quite anxious about you when you leave me; please
look a little more cheerful for my sake.”</p>

<p>“For your sake, my pretty pleader, I would accomplish
a much harder task,” replied Broughton, with
assumed gayety, as he encircled the widow’s form with
his arm, and pressed a kiss on her white forehead.</p>

<p>During the remainder of that evening he was as
loving and attentive as even the most exacting lady
love could have desired, and left Mrs. Neville in the
happy belief that her idolatrous fondness for him was
fully reciprocated.</p>

<p>But once outside her home the man’s whole demeanor
changed, and as he wended his way to the
hotel at which he had taken up his residence, he was
saying to himself:</p>

<p>“Bah! how hard it is for me to humor her jealous
whims, and to keep up a pretense of fondness for her.<span class="pagenum">[238]</span>
If I had allowed her to continue in her belief that I
admired this Maggie Gordon, she would have succeeded
in getting the girl out of the way.”</p>

<p>Charles Broughton had reached his hotel by this
time, and encountered a friend who had been awaiting
his arrival in the reading room, and who greeted him
with an exclamation of astonishment.</p>

<p>“Heavens, Charley, how ill you look!”</p>

<p>“Never mind my looks, my friend; I am a little
under the weather, but I don’t care to be reminded
of it continually. Come up to my den, and let me
see if a chat with you and a glass of wine will not
restore me,” said Broughton carelessly; and a few
moments later found the friends chatting and laughing
over their wine and cigars.</p>

<p>But always between Charles Broughton and the
ruby liquid he raised so often to his lips came the
beautiful face and violet eyes of the girl who had
declared herself to be Maggie Gordon.</p>

</div>


<p>“Miss Iris! Oh, please excuse me, I promised to
call you always Maggie, but I am so frightened&mdash;I
don’t know what I say. Maggie, are you awake? My
mother is very ill, I fear; I do not know what to do
for her. Won’t you please get up and look at her?”</p>

<p>It was the night following that on which Iris had
first entered the humble home of Jenny Mason, and
a comfortable couch had been provided for her&mdash;at
her own expense&mdash;in the little bedroom opening off
the apartment which served as sitting room, dining
room, and kitchen in one.</p>

<p>It was after eleven o’clock that night when Jenny
aroused Iris from a deep sleep.</p>

<p>She arose from her bed with a sickening sense of
dizziness and an oppressing weight on her heart, but
one glance into the white, pained face of Jenny’s suffering
mother gave her a false power of endurance.</p>

<p>It was plain to even her experienced eye&mdash;and she
had never yet looked upon a person in the death struggle&mdash;that
Mrs. Mason would never see another sunrise.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jenny, you must bring a doctor at once!” cried
Iris, but at the sound of these words the invalid’s
fingers closed tighter around the hand of her child.</p>

<p>“Do not leave me&mdash;no doctor can&mdash;give me one
moment of life. I want you with me&mdash;till the end
comes!” she whispered, and Iris had not the heart
to oppose the dying woman’s wishes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[240]</span></p>

<p>“Tell me where the doctor lives!” Iris whispered.</p>

<p>Jenny offered a feeble remonstrance, but Iris would
not listen, and, a moment later, the latter was hurrying
through the city streets.</p>

<p>The doctor of whom she was in search resided about
a dozen blocks from the residence of Mrs. Mason, and
Iris had gone about half that distance when two gentlemen
met her face to face.</p>

<p>She was not veiled, and the moonlight fell upon
her beautiful, pale face.</p>

<p>At sight of her both of the gentlemen started, and
Iris in her turn&mdash;having recognized in one of these
men the gentleman whose face had so strangely started
her on the previous evening&mdash;uttered an exclamation
of dismay at first, but quickly recovering herself, bent
her head in acknowledgment of her recognition of
him, and hurried on without a glance into the face
of his companion, with whom she had often danced
and chatted in the days when she believed herself the
young daughter and joint heiress of Oscar Hilton.</p>

<p>Iris had not gone two dozen paces away from them
when the companion of Charles Broughton clasped
the latter’s arm excitedly.</p>

<p>“What can be the matter, Charley? Do you know
anything about it? Iris Hilton is not the girl whom
I would expect to find walking the streets at night
alone, and at this hour, too. Why, Broughton, it is
nearly half past eleven. I shall follow her&mdash;there must
be something wrong.”</p>

<p>With these words, Gerald Dare, who had been a
secret admirer of Oscar Hilton’s younger daughter,
was about to start in pursuit of the lonely girl, but<span class="pagenum">[241]</span>
the firm grip of Charles Broughton’s hand upon his
arm restrained him.</p>

<p>At the first mention of the name “Iris,” a gray,
ashen pallor had crept over Broughton’s face, and his
breath had been quickly indrawn, like that of one who
was drowning.</p>

<p>“Walk with me, Dare, to the nearest café&mdash;that
deathly feeling of weakness is creeping over me again.
You know how ill I was last night!”</p>

<p>His voice was so faint and tremulous that Dare
was really alarmed, and accompanied his friend to a
café, thus giving Iris a chance to escape his espionage,
exactly the object which Broughton desired to attain.</p>

<p>Iris pursued her way to the doctor’s residence unmolested,
and was fortunate enough to find that gentleman
still in his office, he having just returned from
visiting one of his serious cases.</p>

<p>Iris would have left the place at once on stating her
errand, and gaining his promise to follow her immediately,
but something in the expression of her wan,
white face, with its innate and unmistakable look of
refinement, had led the doctor to detain her.</p>

<p>“My child, you are yourself sadly in need of a
physician’s care. You are not fit to be out at night
alone. Wait just one moment, and I will have my
gig made ready, and you and I will drive to Mrs.
Mason’s together.”</p>

<p>They reached the tenement in which Mrs. Mason
resided, some minutes after midnight; but, as the old
physician saw at a glance, his coming had been in
vain.</p>

<p>The grim King of Terrors had entered before him,<span class="pagenum">[242]</span>
and the white, still form beside which Jenny Mason
knelt was only a senseless and feelingless statue of
clay&mdash;all that remained was the earthly tenement
whence the immortal spirit had fled.</p>

<p>We will not linger over the days that followed;
suffice it to say that the last dollar of which Iris had
been possessed when she left the home of her reputed
father was spent in defraying the funeral expenses of
Mrs. Mason.</p>

<p>On the second day after Mrs. Mason’s burial Isabel
Hilton called on Jenny, and reproached the latter
sharply for failing to have her dress completed, refusing
even to excuse the poor girl when she offered
her mother’s death as an apology for failing to fulfill
her contract.</p>

<p>Iris remained hidden in the inner room during
Isabel’s visit, but the latter made no mention whatever
of her missing sister’s name.</p>

<p>She quietly informed Jenny that in the future she
would have no work for her, as she was not fond of
disappointments, and left the unhappy little dressmaker
in despair, as Mrs. Clara Neville had also withdrawn
her patronage.</p>

<p>After this it was impossible for Iris and Jenny to
live as the latter had formerly been able to do.</p>

<p>There came a day when the two girls left their
humble home in search of work, without having eaten
any breakfast, for the simple reason that there was
not even a loaf of bread in the house.</p>

<p>Jenny soon succeeded in obtaining employment of
a fashionable modiste in Forty-first Street, near Fifth
Avenue, but Iris&mdash;or Maggie Gordon&mdash;must consent<span class="pagenum">[243]</span>
to work six months for Madam Ward as an apprentice,
if she would learn the trade by which her friend
earned a livelihood.</p>

<p>Jenny urged her to accept the offer.</p>

<p>“Do consent to stay here, Maggie; madam seems
to be a kind lady, and the girls with whom we will
have to work&mdash;Emma and Sarah&mdash;have every appearance
of being quiet and ladylike girls, who will never
pry into your business or make themselves too
familiar.”</p>

<p>Iris consented to Jenny’s plan, even remembering
that she had not one dollar to her name, but thinking
that the jewelry of which she was possessed&mdash;if sold&mdash;would
bring her money enough to defray her expenses
until she could learn to work with Jenny.</p>

<p>Jenny made it a condition with Madam Ward that
Maggie should not be separated from her, and consequently
another day found Maggie Gordon, with
Jenny Mason, Emma Henry, and Sarah Bennett, engaged
in the making of an elegant costume of white
satin and point lace&mdash;the bridal dress of Mrs. Clara
Neville, to be worn on the occasion of that lady’s marriage
with Mr. Charles Broughton.</p>

<p>Despite all her brave efforts to accomplish the work
expected of her, the constant and unusual confinement
of the workroom quickly told upon Iris; and
on the third day of her engagement with Madam
Ward she was obliged to quit her work shortly after
noontime, unable longer to combat the deathly feeling
of sickness that had been gradually creeping upon her
since the night of Mrs. Mason’s death.</p>

<p>Emma, who was just returning from the bank&mdash;where<span class="pagenum">[244]</span>
she had been sent to change a check for her
employer&mdash;met Maggie at the hall door.</p>

<p>“I have a telegram for you, Maggie; I signed the
receipt myself to save you the trouble of coming downstairs,”
said Emma, in her gentle, sympathetic voice;
and Maggie could only bow her head in acknowledgment
of Emma’s kindness, as she took the ominous
yellow envelope from the latter’s hand, and seated
herself, weak and trembling, on the lower step of the
stairs leading to the workroom, to make herself mistress
of its contents.</p>

<p>The girl, Emma, with the true instincts of a gentlewoman,
passed up the stairs without waiting to see
how the contents of the yellow envelope would affect
her fellow worker, although her young heart ached
for the girl whose sufferings she could read so plainly
in the sorrowful eyes and pallid features for a moment
uplifted to her gaze.</p>

<p>Maggie was therefore all alone when she opened the
telegram, and read the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">To Iris&mdash;or Maggie Gordon</span>: If you ever cared
for Chester St. John come to him now. He is dying,
and calls for you with every breath. He cannot live
one hour from the time you receive this telegram; so
if you slight this message you will render his last
moments unhappy. Should you care to see him alive,
call immediately at No. 685B Lexington Avenue.”</p>
</div>

<p>Iris read the message over and over again.</p>

<p>All the memory of the bitter words that had passed
Chester St. John’s lips when he bade her farewell
faded from her brain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[245]</span></p>

<p>She scarcely looked at the name signed to the telegram&mdash;Gerald
Dare.</p>

<p>She thought of nothing but that Chester St. John
was dying, and that she loved him with all her heart
and soul.</p>

<p>And with the telegram crushed in her hand, and
only the thought of her approaching meeting with
Chester St. John keeping her from giving way to that
sickening sensation of weakness, she turned her steps
in the direction of the house in Lexington Avenue,
without a thought that any treachery had lured her
thither, although St. John’s residence was not in that
locality.</p>

<p>It never occurred to her to wonder how this Gerald
Dare knew of her change of name, and the place where
she worked.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A CRUEL STRATAGEM.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Several of the friends whom Iris Hilton had visited
in the days of her prosperity resided on Lexington
Avenue, and she knew that the number mentioned in
the dispatch was in the neighborhood of Twenty-third
Street, so that she had not more than a dozen blocks
to walk from Madam Ward’s establishment to her
destination.</p>

<p>At last the goal was reached, and she stood still
for one moment before she could ascend the high stone
stoop, pressing her hands to her heart, and praying
for strength to go through the ordeal before her.</p>

<p>“He must not see me looking so ill&mdash;as I feel I
am looking now. Oh, my darling! My brave, strong,
noble love, what can have stricken you down so soon?”
she murmured; and summoning all her strength to overcome
the faintness that was creeping slowly upon her,
she ascended the steps and rang a soft peal at the
doorbell.</p>

<p>A stolid-looking colored man opened the door at
her summons, and the girl tried to read in his face
some knowledge of the true state of affairs in his
master’s household, but she might as well have sought
to penetrate the countenance of a statue.</p>

<p>“I wish to see him&mdash;Mr. St. John&mdash;they&mdash;they telegraphed
for me,” she said, with a quick, panting
breath, and at her words the ebony statue smiled and
opened the door wider, that she might enter.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, missy, I have had my orders to admit<span class="pagenum">[247]</span>
you,” he said, and something in his careless, and even
jovial manner gave Iris a hope that things were not
so bad with Chester St. John as she had feared.</p>

<p>“Will you take me to him now&mdash;at once,” she cried.
“Oh, please make no delay&mdash;I am very calm, I shall
say or do nothing to excite him.”</p>

<p>“All right, missy, just you follow me,” replied the
negro; and, still smiling blandly, he led the way to a
room in the second story.</p>

<p>On the threshold of this room the girl paused, her
heart beating tumultuously, and her fair, young face
growing white as the dead.</p>

<p>“Oh, God, grant that he may recognize me, and
that I may teach him to know that I was never false
to him,” she prayed, and then, forcing back the sobs
that were rising in her throat, she followed the servant
into the room, stepping softly in her fear of disturbing
the invalid, but recoiling with a little cry of
repugnance and dismay as her eyes fell upon the face
of the man who had come forward to meet her&mdash;the
handsome, saturnine face of Charles Broughton.</p>

<p>As yet she had not conceived any idea of treachery,
and after this first involuntary shrinking from the man
whom, for some reason, she disliked and feared&mdash;she
would not allow herself to think of anything but
Chester St. John.</p>

<p>“Where is he?” she whispered, with a wild glance
around the room; and at her words Broughton broke
into a low, mocking laugh.</p>

<p>“My dear, you must grant me your pardon for
luring you here by stratagem. Your lover is&mdash;for
aught I know to the contrary&mdash;as well as you or I<span class="pagenum">[248]</span>
at this moment; but I knew of no other way of gaining
an interview with you, and so took the liberty of
using his name to accomplish my purpose&mdash;don’t look
so horrified&mdash;I mean no harm to you&mdash;sit down, and
Sam shall bring you some wine.”</p>

<p>There was no need for him to tell her to be seated.</p>

<p>She had fallen into the chair nearest her, trembling
in every limb, and for the moment utterly incapable
of speech or motion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the day subsequent to that on which Iris had
left the home of Oscar Hilton, Isabel, the beloved
daughter of the latter, was taken suddenly and dangerously
ill, and the fond father was almost beside
himself with fear for his darling’s safety.</p>

<p>But for this greater and all-absorbing sorrow he
would have caused an immediate search to be made
for Iris, as it had been no part of his policy to drive
the girl from his roof.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hilton, as has been mentioned, was a confirmed
invalid, and Iris had been her constant attendant.</p>

<p>She fretted and lamented her daughter’s absence
now to such an extent that Mr. Hilton could not bear
to enter her presence.</p>

<p>Evelyn Hilton had been a woman of rare and unusual
beauty, and of the poor remains of this loveliness
she was even now foolishly proud.</p>

<p>She was a vain, selfish woman, inordinately fond
of dress and luxurious living, and with little affection
to bestow on any object but self.</p>

<p>She had never seemed to bear the real mother love<span class="pagenum">[249]</span>
for her only child, being unable to understand the
noble nature of Iris, a nature high above her own as
the stars above the earth.</p>

<p>It gave her no pain now to think of her child’s
probable fate, but she lamented in bitter terms the
girl’s heartlessness in leaving her to the care of hirelings.</p>

<p>“Why did you say anything to drive her away,
Oscar? You know how sadly I shall miss her. I
shall never be able to sleep without her voice to read
to me, and no one can soothe me as Iris could, when
I suffer with that dreadful pain in my head. You
must find her and bring her back to me. I cannot
get along without Iris; indeed, I cannot, Oscar,” the
invalid had cried to her husband; and he had promised
to find the girl if possible, and would certainly
have made an attempt to do so had it not been for
the fact of Isabel’s alarming seizure.</p>

<p>This put all thoughts of Iris from his mind, and
during the three days that followed the house was
in a state of confusion impossible to describe.</p>

<p>It appeared that every doctor of note in the city
was called in to prescribe for Isabel, and it soon became
known throughout the circle to which proud,
dark-eyed Isabel had been wont to mingle that Oscar
Hilton’s daughter’s life was despaired of.</p>

<p>On the fourth day of Isabel’s illness Chester St.
John, who had left the city on the day when Iris rejected
his love, returned to his home, and, chancing
to hear of the illness of Hilton’s daughter through the
conversation of two gentlemen in his clubroom, at
once concluded that the sufferer was the girl whom<span class="pagenum">[250]</span>
he had loved&mdash;nay, whom he still loved as he could
never love another, although her own words had condemned
her as a heartless coquette, and he had parted
from her with bitter words of reproach and recrimination.</p>

<p>“Iris dying! Oh, it cannot be! My bright, beautiful
love,” he groaned, and the impulse to go to her
home and beg them to let him look upon her face
once more was too strong to be resisted.</p>

<p>He remembered now, when he had believed that
Heaven was taking her from him&mdash;remembered with
an anguish keen as death&mdash;the last look he had seen
in the deep blue eyes of Iris&mdash;the look of passionate
love and bitter pain that had followed him, even while
her cruel lips sent him from her.</p>

<p>“There was some mistake&mdash;oh, my love! My precious
little Iris, if I could see you now you would
make it plain to me,” he thought, and walked directly
from the club to Oscar Hilton’s, his heart turning sick
within him as he approached the house, and a terrible
fear came to him that he might see long streamers of
crape and white ribbon streaming from the bell handle.</p>

<p>“I think the sight would have killed me,” he murmured,
as he stood on the threshold awaiting admittance
a few minutes later.</p>

<p>On this day Isabel had been pronounced “out of
danger,” and Oscar Hilton consented to leave her
bedside long enough to see Mr. St. John.</p>

<p>The desire to win this rich man for his daughter’s
husband instantly revived in the father’s heart at
sight of Chester’s card, and he left the presence of
the girl who had been so near to the portals of death<span class="pagenum">[251]</span>
with no prayer of thanksgiving in his heart to the
God who had spared her to him, but with wild schemes
running through his brain for her worldly advancement.
He knew that when she gained her strength
again she would stop at nothing to bring this proud,
handsome Chester St. John to her feet, and he himself
had a plan by which he hoped to aid her in the
accomplishment of this purpose.</p>

<p>On entering the little reception room into which a
servant had shown St. John, Mr. Hilton was startled
by the almost ghastly pallor of the young man’s face.
He was not long in making the discovery that it was
fears for the life of Iris, and no anxiety for Isabel,
that had wrought this change in the strong, proud man
before him, and a fierce and unreasoning hatred sprang
to life in his heart for the hapless child whose sweet,
young face had had power to awaken such a wondrous
depth of love in this man’s soul, a love that
his own queenly Isabel had failed as yet to inspire.</p>

<p>The plans which had been hitherto vague and shadowy
took sudden form and shape in his scheming
brain, and when Chester St. John left the house, nearly
an hour later, Oscar Hilton watched his retreating
form with a look almost amounting to triumph.</p>

<p>“I have shaken his faith in her, even as she herself
could not shake it, although she assured him she had
no love for him, and led him to think her a coquette.
He will not seek her now, although he does not as yet
believe&mdash;as I hinted to him&mdash;that she has left my roof
for the arms of some unworthy lover. He shall believe
it, though&mdash;if Evelyn has not forgotten her cunning
in imitating her daughter’s pretty penmanship.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE CHILD OF AN ESCAPED CONVICT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In all her life Iris had never experienced such a
feeling of horror as that which filled her heart on
finding that she had been trapped to the house on
Lexington Avenue by the man whom we know as
Charley Broughton.</p>

<p>“Let me go away. What wrong have I ever done
you that you should terrify me thus? What can you
want of me?” she faltered, staggering like one under
the influence of liquor, as she attempted to walk to
the door.</p>

<p>But for all answer Broughton forced her back into
the chair from which she had arisen, laughing sardonically
at her childish betrayal of terror.</p>

<p>“My pretty one! I tell you I mean you no harm;
why do you fear me so; do you know me?”</p>

<p>Iris shuddered, and covered her eyes with her hands
to shut out the sight of his face.</p>

<p>“Do you know me, little Iris?” he repeated, fearing
that she had not heard his question, and laying a particular
stress on the name Iris.</p>

<p>“I will tell you all I know of you,” cried the girl
at last, with a suddenness that startled Broughton
more than he would have cared to confess. “One day,
some three years ago, my mother, who is an invalid
confined to her own chamber, sent me to her writing
desk in search of some prescription&mdash;or the receipt of
a remedy that would ease her pain. In my haste I<span class="pagenum">[253]</span>
overturned the desk, and shattered it, as the wood
was old and dried. While I was gathering up the contents,
which had been scattered upon the floor, I found
among them a small gold locket which I had never
seen my mother wear. It was set with pearls, and I
admired it greatly. I remember that my mother cried
out in alarm when she saw the locket in my hands,
but I had already opened it, and saw within it the
picture of a man’s face&mdash;your face. I questioned my
mother concerning the original, and for the first time
in my life saw her violently agitated. She told me
then that the man whose face I gazed upon in a
species of fascination was my enemy&mdash;my enemy and
hers, and if ever I met him in life to beware of him,
for he would leave no means untried to work my ruin.
That time has come, and your conduct toward me
proves that my mother’s fears were not without foundation.
I am in your power, a weak and unprotected
girl, while you are strong and powerful and pitiless;
but although I was terrified at first by the means
which you employed to lure me into your power, I
am not afraid of you now, for I remember that there
is a God who knoweth even the fall of the sparrow,
and that the same God watches over me in this&mdash;my
hour of peril.”</p>

<p>Iris had arisen from her chair while speaking, and
stood before Charles Broughton in an attitude of defiance,
her small hands folded on her breast, her pretty,
bright-tressed head thrown back, and her eyes uplifted
in childish faith and confidence to the God who seems
so dear to such as her.</p>

<p>For one brief moment, Charles Broughton, sin-hardened,<span class="pagenum">[254]</span>
worldly, and unprincipled though he was, turned
his eyes away from the sight of that pure, uplifted
face, ashamed of his own vileness; but, alas! he did
not listen long to the promptings of his better nature.
The one aim and object of his life was to be revenged
on one who had bitterly wronged him, and through
this innocent child before him he saw the means of
striking the first blow for the accomplishment of this
revenge.</p>

<p>“You shall know the reason I have for being an
enemy to the woman you call mother,” he said. “You
shall know why Evelyn Hilton speaks of me as her
enemy and yours. Twenty years ago I was not the
man you see before you to-day. I was young and
hopeful and tender-hearted.</p>

<p>“It is true I had been led into bad company, and
had allowed myself to be drawn into temptation; but
when I met the girl whom it was my fate to love, I
swore to overcome all this temptation and to live a
life I need not be ashamed to ask her to share.</p>

<p>“She was a poor girl, and married me; not because
she loved me, but for the reason that my father was
a wealthy man, and she hoped to live a luxurious life
as the wife of his only son and heir.</p>

<p>“In this she was disappointed, for in the very hour
in which he learned that I had made Evelyn Hardress
my wife, he disinherited me, and, dying two months
later, left all his wealth to the endowment of a charitable
institution, cutting me off with the mocking bequest
of one dollar.</p>

<p>“Had I been alone the sufferer, I would not have
felt this injustice so bitterly; but my young wife was<span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
passionately fond of the luxuries wealth alone could
buy, and as I still loved her passionately, it almost
killed me to be obliged to deny her anything for which
she craved.</p>

<p>“At last I was obliged to tell her the truth; and
from that hour my nature changed, until from the
weak, extravagant, but foolishly fond boy of twenty
years ago, you see me the bitter, vengeful man of
to-day.</p>

<p>“You shrink from me still, and your heart clings
to the woman who gave you birth; but you can never
know what agony I endured for that woman’s sake.</p>

<p>“A distant relative of my father offered me at this
time a position as cashier in his bank, and my acceptance
of this offer sealed my doom. My wife was
dearer to me than any consideration of honor, and
when she threw herself weeping on my breast, lamenting
that she could not attend a party to which
she had been invited because of her inability to dress
as richly as she had been used to do, I committed
my first crime. I appropriated one thousand dollars
of the money intrusted to my care, and gave it to
her for her personal adornment. I saw her decked
in the robes purchased at the sacrifice of my honor.
I knew that I had become a thief for her sake, and
yet I gloried in her peerless beauty, and never loved
her as passionately as on that night when I heard
her spoken of as the most beautiful woman in all
that crowded assemblage.</p>

<p>“It was not love I felt for her, but a blind infatuation
that led me on to repeat my first crime time and
again, until from very terror of detection I determined<span class="pagenum">[256]</span>
to quit the country. Evelyn encouraged me
in this determination, until, just one day previous to
that on which I was to have taken my departure for
Europe, where I hoped to earn the wherewithal to
repay the large sums I had purloined, I was arrested
on the charge of forgery, a check having been presented
at the bank bearing the signature of one of
our wealthiest depositors, but written in a hand that
was instantly recognized as my own.</p>

<p>“I could almost have sworn it myself to be my
own handwriting, so perfect and faultless was the
imitation; but after the first shock of this awful accusation
was over I recognized it as the work of my
wife, who had often boasted of her talent in copying
the handwriting of any person whose penmanship she
had ever studied.</p>

<p>“I made no charge against her at the time; indeed,
I think the shock of the discovery deprived me for
a time of my reason, and I remember nothing definitely
until I recovered to find myself in a prison cell,
branded as a felon, and doomed to years of confinement.</p>

<p>“When at last, after five years’ imprisonment, the
full realization of my position was brought home to
me, I swore a bitter and terrible oath of vengeance
on the woman who had dragged me down to the
lowest depths of degradation, on her and her offspring
forever.</p>

<p>“I was allowed a limited communication with
friends in the outside world, who had known and
respected me in the days of my prosperity, and from
them I learned that Evelyn, who had succeeded in<span class="pagenum">[257]</span>
obtaining a divorce from me, had married a retired
merchant named Oscar Hilton, and was living the
luxurious life of which she had been always so fond.</p>

<p>“From these friends, also, I learned that she had
given birth, some two months previous to her marriage
with Hilton, to a female child, to whom, after
her usual romantic notions, she had given the name
of Cleopatra’s handmaiden, Iris.</p>

<p>“I believed at the time, as I believe now, that you,
Iris, are my child as surely as you are Evelyn Hilton’s,
and I claim an equal right to your obedience.</p>

<p>“I have no love for you, I must tell you frankly;
you are too much like the woman who has cursed
my life, and made me the reckless wretch I am to-day.
You are beautiful as a siren, with the fatal beauty that
lured me to destruction, and I have resolved that you
shall never betray a good man’s trust as your mother
betrayed mine.</p>

<p>“You are my child, Iris Trisilian, and you shall
stay with me and do my bidding; nay, it is useless
for you to glance so significantly toward the door&mdash;as
well might a bird hope to escape the toils of a
charmer, as you expect to leave my care.”</p>

<p>The man who had called himself Charles Broughton
took forcible possession of the girl’s hands now,
and attempted to seat her in the chair near which
she stood; but at this moment the sound of low knocking
on the door interrupted him.</p>

<p>Something in the expression of her face half frightened
Charles Broughton, and grasping her arm almost
rudely, he whispered:</p>

<p>“Do not contradict anything I say, no matter how<span class="pagenum">[258]</span>
far I may depart from the truth. Do not dare to
carry out the defiance your looks express, if you
would not have me brand you as the daughter of a
felon&mdash;and not only the child of a forger, but of an
escaped convict. Say one word to betray me, and
the proud aristocrat who has declared his love for
you&mdash;the haughty Chester St. John, who is so proud
of his spotless reputation and ancient lineage&mdash;shall
know you as the offspring of Carleton Tresilian. Ah,
I think that was some one knocking on the door&mdash;come
in!” And Charles Broughton threw himself
negligently into a chair at some distance from Iris,
who was sitting now with her head thrown back
among the cushions of an easy-chair, her hands locked
tightly together in her lap, and those terrible words
to which she had listened a moment before repeating
themselves over and over again in her tortured brain&mdash;“the
child of an escaped convict.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_L">CHAPTER L.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">SUNDERED HEARTS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>On the afternoon of the day following Chester St.
John’s visit to Mr. Hilton, the former was seated alone
in the library of his father’s mansion on Fifth Avenue,
pondering sadly over the change that seemed to have
come over all his life since the hour when the hope
he had cherished of winning Iris for his wife had
been shattered by her own cruel rejection of him.</p>

<p>He felt assured that there was some mystery connected
with Iris’ flight from the home of the man
he still believed to be her father, but that this mystery
was connected with any unworthy love never for one
moment occurred to the loyal heart of Chester St.
John, Oscar Hilton’s hints to that effect notwithstanding.</p>

<p>While he was thinking thus, a servant brought him
a card bearing the name of Oscar Hilton, and informed
him that that gentleman was waiting to see
him downstairs.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven, he brings me some news of Iris!”
was Chester’s first thought. But his first glimpse
into Hilton’s face showed him that whatever the tidings
the latter brought there was in them no cause
for rejoicing.</p>

<p>Mr. Hilton was very pale, and his face wore an
expression of deep sorrow.</p>

<p>“I am in great trouble,” he said, in answer to Chester’s
anxious inquiry, and stood for a moment with<span class="pagenum">[260]</span>
his hands clasped on the low, marble mantel, and his
face hidden in them.</p>

<p>St. John was terribly alarmed, but could not give
voice to his fears, and Hilton himself was obliged to
resume the conversation.</p>

<p>“I came to you, St. John, because I know you loved
my unfortunate child, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My God, what is it? What has happened? Do
not keep me in suspense; tell me the worst,” cried the
young man hoarsely.</p>

<p>And with his hatred for unhappy Iris growing
stronger than ever with every fresh evidence of this
man’s love for her, Hilton exclaimed:</p>

<p>“The worst is only this&mdash;that Iris is unworthy your
love or mine. Chester St. John, I will tell you a secret
you should never have known but for that girl’s ingratitude
to me. Iris is no child of mine; her mother
was, when I first met her, the divorced wife of a
man who was serving out a term of imprisonment
for forgery.</p>

<p>“You can understand my infatuation, St. John,
when I tell you that the mother at that time was far
more beautiful than the daughter is to-day. Iris was
then a child of two years, and I promised to rear her
as my own, and have faithfully kept my vow, as you
may have seen, making no difference between her and
my own child, Isabel. When I listened to your confession
of love for her, you may have seen that I
was agitated, but even then I would have allowed you
to take the girl to your heart without revealing a
word of the truth to you, in my affection for her,
had it not been for her conduct since that time. But<span class="pagenum">[261]</span>
what is the matter with you? Why do you look at
me so strangely?”</p>

<p>“I think I understand now the reason she rejected
me. You were not so kind to her as you tried to be
to me. You told her this story of her unhappy parentage,
and the poor child was too proud to come to
me with this stain upon her name, my poor, little
love!”</p>

<p>The tone of exquisite tenderness in which these last
words were spoken enraged Hilton almost beyond
power of control, and he could not quite conceal his
exultation as he handed Chester a dainty, pink-tinted
envelope, with his own name written in a feminine
hand on its face.</p>

<p>He recognized the penmanship instantly as that of
Iris, who had once copied a song for him, and whose
notes to his sister Grace he had read on several occasions.</p>

<p>“Read the letter; you have a right to be made acquainted
with its contents,” said Mr. Hilton; and
thus urged, St. John took the letter, upon which Iris’
blue eyes had never fallen, and read words that separated
him from her so effectually that unless the truth
of this missive should be discovered, she would be to
him henceforth as the greatest stranger&mdash;a woman
whom he could no longer respect.</p>

<p>He handed the letter back to Oscar Hilton in silence,
but his face was as white as it would ever be in its
coffin, and his hand trembled so that the letter fluttered
from his hold to the floor.</p>

<p>“I thank you for having awakened me from my
dream,” he said hoarsely; and a few minutes later<span class="pagenum">[262]</span>
Mr. Hilton took his departure, exulting in the thought
that if Chester St. John and Iris Tresilian met face
to face on the morrow, the former would pass the
girl as if she were a stranger; and it now only remained
for Isabel to win the heart which no longer
belonged to another.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">OSCAR HILTON’S TRIUMPH.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The letter shown to Chester St. John was, as the
reader has doubtless surmised, the work of Evelyn
Hilton, and written at the dictation of her husband.</p>

<p>Cold and unkind though she had been to her daughter
while the latter had been in attendance on her,
it cost her a struggle to write the words that would
make her child appear in such an evil light to the man
for whose eye it was intended.</p>

<p>There had been a stormy scene in the chamber of
the invalid on the occasion of the writing of this letter,
for at first Mrs. Hilton had boldly declined to
do the work required of her.</p>

<p>“You shall write the letter, and write just exactly
as I dictate you. How dare you refuse to obey me?”
he almost shouted, grasping Evelyn’s delicate wrist
so tightly that she cried out with pain.</p>

<p>Even after this outburst she ventured to offer another
feeble protest.</p>

<p>“How can you ask me to do that which will ruin
the reputation of my own child? Oh, Oscar, think
of your own Isabel. Could any threat of harm to
yourself or any inducement that could be offered you
compel you to write one line that would injure her?”</p>

<p>“You amuse me, Evelyn, you are developing rare
dramatic talent in your old age&mdash;your pretense of
love for your child is really a fine piece of acting&mdash;bah!
Do you think I believe it is anything more than<span class="pagenum">[264]</span>
acting? Did you love your child when you would
have placed her in an asylum sixteen years ago? A
little, helpless toddler of two years? You talk of
the ties of natural affection! What had you done
with that sentiment when you forged your husband’s
name, and branded the man who had loved you truly
as felon, suffering him to be cast into a prison for
your sins? Good heavens, I have killed her!”</p>

<p>The last exclamation broke from Hilton’s lips with
a cry of unfeigned alarm, for Evelyn had fallen back
like one dead among the cushions of her easy-chair.</p>

<p>Oscar Hilton had loved this woman&mdash;next to his
idolized daughter&mdash;better than anything in life, and
she had not even yet lost all sway over his selfish heart.</p>

<p>He was thoroughly alarmed now, and used every
effort in his power to restore her, fearing to call any
assistance lest in her first moments of awakening to
life she might say something to betray her perilous
secret.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that hours had passed before his
efforts were rewarded with success, and the dark-blue
eyes he had once thought so beautiful lost that strained
and awful look that had so terrified him.</p>

<p>“How did you learn my secret?” she cried, when
fully restored.</p>

<p>“Your secret is known only to myself, Evelyn, and
I assure you it is safe with me as long as you strive
to please me and obey me. I learned the truth from
your own lips, while you were sleeping at my side.
You have a habit of talking aloud, and quite connectedly
in your sleep, and you rave of that forged note
continually. You are white and trembling still; drink<span class="pagenum">[265]</span>
this glass of wine, and when you are little stronger
I will dictate the words I wish you to write in your
daughter’s name. The imitation of her handwriting
will be no trouble to you, I know, for you have often
boasted to me of your skill in this sort of work. Have
you decided to obey me, Evelyn?”</p>

<p>“I have no choice left me but to obey you,” the
woman answered, in a tone of intense weariness; and
half an hour later found her engaged in writing the
letter that was destined to cause her child many an
hour of keen suffering. It was addressed to Oscar
Hilton, and read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am leaving your home to follow the fortunes of
a man whom I love, but of whom I know you would
not approve. I can tell you nothing concerning him,
only the simple fact of my love for him. I know
you had set your heart upon my marriage with Chester
St. John, but this could never have been.</p>

<p>“I like Mr. St. John very much, and I may have
deceived him into the belief that I returned his affection
for me, but I could not help it; it was so pleasant
for me to feel in company that I had the power to
retain the handsomest and wealthiest man among them
by my side, while the other ladies were dying of envy.</p>

<p>“I am sorry now that I did so, because I know that
I have often given pain to your Isabel, who loves
Chester St. John with her whole heart. She never
betrayed her secret to me until I told her of his proposal,
and then she could not hide it.</p>

<p>“Her face turned white as death, and I heard her
whisper his name over and over in such a tone of<span class="pagenum">[266]</span>
love and sorrow that I was ashamed of my own
heartless conduct.</p>

<p>“I hope he will learn to love Isabel, she is much
more worthy than I am, and better fitted to grace his
home.</p>

<p>“When you receive this I shall be with the man of
my choice.</p>

<p>“Break the news as gently as possible to my mother,
and ask her to forgive and forget her willful daughter,</p>

<p class="ir1">“<span class="smcap">Iris</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>This was the letter, and hardened and worldly as
was the woman who wrote it, a tear fell on the open
page before her as she signed the name of the sweet-faced
girl who had never given her an angry or impatient
word.</p>

<p>On the day following that on which he had shown
St. John the letter, Mr. Hilton met Chester face to
face on Broadway, and on the latter’s making a polite
inquiry for Miss Hilton, answered in a grave and
sorrowful tone:</p>

<p>“She does not appear to be making much progress
toward recovery. Her doctors say she makes no
effort, and they are astonished that one so young and
lovely should seem to have so little desire for life.
St. John, it would kill me to give her up,” and Hilton
grasped the arm of his companion with a passionate
vehemence that contrasted oddly with his usual calm
and collected demeanor. “It would kill me,” he reiterated,
“and to save her I would suffer any humiliation.
St. John, you know the secret sorrow that is
breaking my darling’s proud heart; I was obliged to<span class="pagenum">[267]</span>
expose it to you when I showed you Iris’ heartless
letter. Will not you do something to restore her to
me? Call on her as a friend. Do not let her think
that you have deserted our home because of Iris’ cruel
treatment&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush, Mr. Hilton; please do not mention that
name in my hearing,” exclaimed St. John, drawing his
arm out of that of his companion with a shudder of
uncontrollable repulsion.</p>

<p>The interview ended with a half reluctant promise
from St. John to call on Isabel, and Isabel’s father
went on his way triumphant, thinking as he proceeded
toward his home: “Before another month is over,
my darling shall be Chester St. John’s promised wife,
and whether I fail or prosper, her future will be well
provided for.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">ANOTHER ENEMY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The person who entered the presence of Iris and
Charles Broughton at the latter’s invitation, was Mr.
Gerald Dare, the young man who had recognized Iris
while walking with Broughton on the night of Mrs.
Mason’s death.</p>

<p>At sight of Iris now, seated in close proximity to
his friend Broughton, Dare was literally spellbound,
and found it impossible to conceal his astonishment.</p>

<p>“Iris Hilton!” he exclaimed, involuntarily uttering
the name by which he had known her; and then
catching the angry, indignant look in Broughton’s
eyes, he sought to offer some apology for his rudeness.
As for Iris herself, she uttered no word or
sound.</p>

<p>“You told me to call at this hour, Broughton,” began
Dare in a confused and hesitating manner; to
which Broughton replied with a laugh:</p>

<p>“Of course I did, my dear boy, and we’ll settle our
little business at once. Come downstairs with me, if
you please; Iris will excuse me and remain here until
I return to her, will you not, my dear?”</p>

<p>At this pointed question Iris lifted her face quickly
with an angry, rebellious flash in her deep blue eyes,
but the words she would have spoken died on her lips
as she encountered his glance, and she could only bow
her head in silence.</p>

<p>Finding herself alone a moment later, she tried to<span class="pagenum">[269]</span>
collect her thoughts, and to arrange some plan for
her future, but the weight of her mother’s sin was
too heavy upon her, and she seemed alike incapable of
thought or action.</p>

<p>“My duty is to obey him, and to so repair the wrong
my mother has done him as to win him from his
scheme of vengeance,” was the noble thought that
came to Iris, even in this hour of her bitter humiliation
and pain; and when Broughton&mdash;as we will still call
the man who had declared his real name to be Carleton
Tresilian&mdash;returned to the room after dismissing his
visitor, Iris, white as the dead, but calm and tearless,
met him with words that filled his heart with a thousand
varying emotions.</p>

<p>“What can I do to repair the cruel wrong you have
suffered at my mother’s hands? I am only a girl,
weak and painfully ignorant of the world and its
ways; but you say you are my father, and I am ready
to obey you&mdash;what would you have me do?”</p>

<p>She was standing before him now, with her beautiful
white face upturned to him, and her hands clasped
tightly before her, showing the strong effort she was
making to control her agitation.</p>

<p>If Iris had borne less resemblance to the woman
who had wronged him, his heart might have softened
to the innocent offspring, but now the girl’s beauty
only recalled to mind the tortures her mother had
forced him to endure, and he laughed mockingly at
her efforts to conciliate him.</p>

<p>“My dear, I know you will obey me, simply for
the reason that I shall compel you to do so. I do not
intend to ask any great sacrifice at your hands; but<span class="pagenum">[270]</span>
before I state what I shall require of you, I want you
to tell me why you left the home of your mother’s
husband so suddenly, and why you fled from the man
who was willing to marry you&mdash;the wealthy Chester
St. John. I have followed up your history pretty
closely since I first looked upon your face in the room
occupied by the sewing girl, Jenny Mason, but the
cause of your leaving Mr. Hilton’s protection I have
not as yet been able to discover. Please tell me the
truth of the matter at once.”</p>

<p>“I left Mr. Hilton’s roof immediately upon learning
that I had no legal right to the benefits he conferred
on me; and as for Mr. St. John&mdash;you know
that I would not marry him, believing myself the child
of a felon!”</p>

<p>“Your home shall be with me for the future&mdash;at
least until I can find a good husband for you. This
is my residence, and as you may observe, it is pretty
comfortable. I have no women in the house save one
old negress, who attends to the chamber work. All
the rest of my servants are males, and colored. I
shall teach them to look upon you as their mistress,
and I do not think you will find it any trouble to
manage them. I receive a great many friends here
almost every evening, and I shall expect you to help
me entertain them. My friends are gentlemen always,
and we employ our time in the enjoyment of a social
game of cards. All I shall require of you, Iris, will
be to dress handsomely, look your prettiest, and make
yourself agreeable to my comrades and friends. Do
you understand?”</p>

<p>Iris had listened to his words with a look of intense<span class="pagenum">[271]</span>
horror gradually creeping into the blue depths
of her wide, dilated eyes.</p>

<p>She did understand his plan, probably more thoroughly
than he had intended her to do. She had read
repeatedly of the fashionable gambling dens to which
men were lured by the beauty of some fair woman
who was employed for no other purpose than to tempt
them hither.</p>

<p>She faced Charles Broughton suddenly, with a flash
of defiance in her great, lustrous eyes.</p>

<p>“I shall not remain in this house; I shall not do what
you ask of me. If you were poor&mdash;though you were
guilty of any sin&mdash;I would work for you; yes, beg
for you, I think, willingly, but to live in luxury, as a
decoy for gamblers, this I cannot and shall not do,
nor can you compel me to do so. Let me go away; I
ask nothing from you; I never wish to see your face
again.”</p>

<p><a id="Ref_273" href="#BRef_273">She</a> made a step toward the door as she ceased
speaking, but Broughton placed himself before it,
laughing mockingly.</p>

<p>“Not so fast, my dear,” he said, with a sneer. “I
have a few words more to say to you, before you
take your departure. I shall not try to detain you
here by force, but there is one thing I would like you
to remember. The day is not far distant when you
shall come to me and beg for a shelter under the roof
you now despise. Go, now, if you will, but I advise
you to think twice before you do so. I am not one
to threaten idly, nor to forget a threat once uttered.
The offer I first made you is still open to you,
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[272]</span></p>

<p>“And I still refuse to accept it as resolutely as
before. Let me go from this house, and I can trust
my after fate with God. I am not afraid that He
will desert me; please stand aside and let me pass.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Miss Iris, have your own way in this
matter; but remember my warning,” he said quietly,
and then opened the door for her, and even preceded
her to the lower hallway, and stood on the steps until
she had left the house.</p>

<p>Once in the open air, Iris felt that she could breathe
more freely, and a weight seemed lifted off her heart
as she turned her steps in the direction of the humble
abode in which she occupied a room with Jenny Mason.</p>

<p>At the very moment when Iris was descending the
broad stone steps of the house in Lexington Avenue,
a limousine was passing the door, and from the window
of the vehicle a lady’s face looked out&mdash;the face
of the rich widow who was Charles Broughton’s affianced
wife.</p>

<p>Clara Neville had glanced toward the house occupied
by the man she loved with some vague hope of
seeing his face near one of the windows, or perhaps
fancying that he might recognize her car and come
down to speak with her.</p>

<p>There had been a smile on her lips, and a happy
expression on her face when she turned toward the
window that commanded the best view of Broughton’s
residence, but this look had changed with the swiftness
of a lightning’s flash to one of the wildest jealousy
and intense hatred when her eyes fell upon the
figure of Iris descending the steps from his door, and
of Broughton himself standing in the doorway, and<span class="pagenum">[273]</span>
so intent on watching the girl’s retreating form that
he did not once glance toward her car as it passed.</p>

<p>Almost choking with rage the widow pulled the
check string and instructed her chauffeur to turn at
the corner and keep Iris in sight until she reached
her destination, no matter to what part of the city
she might lead him.</p>

<p>“All right, ma’am,” the man answered respectfully,
and while Iris walked slowly toward the place she
called home, there was no voice in her heart to tell
her of the woman who followed on her track and
was destined to be the most cruel and bitter enemy
against whom she would be forced to contend in the
new and strange life now opening before her.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">HIDDEN PERILS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Iris found Jenny at home, and terribly alarmed at
her friend’s absence.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Ir&mdash;Maggie, I was so anxious about
you,” she cried, embracing her companion affectionately.</p>

<p>These simple words and display of affection destroyed
the last remnant of strength Iris had striven
so hard to retain, and, throwing herself on Jenny’s
breast, she sobbed as if her heart was breaking.</p>

<p>These tears relieved her overtasked brain, and she
soon recovered herself and turned her sweet face toward
Jenny, with its own bright, winning smile.</p>

<p>“There, dear Jenny, I am all right again, and now
we will commence our life all anew. I shall never
leave you, dear, as long as you care to have me with
you, but you must not ask me anything about the telegram,
or about anything I do that may seem strange
to you. You must only trust me, dear little friend,
and help me to&mdash;forget.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing in the world that would make me
disturb you, Maggie, and I shall never question anything
you may choose to do, no matter how strange
it may appear to me&mdash;but, good gracious! while we
have been talking and crying like two babies, our nice
hot tea has been left to cool on the table. Sit down,
dear; I am actually as hungry as a bear.”</p>

<p>The last remark brought a smile to Maggie’s pale<span class="pagenum">[275]</span>
face, and the two girls were soon chatting pleasantly
over their simple meal.</p>

<p>After this time, as day followed day, and Iris heard
nothing further from Charles Broughton, she began
to experience a sense of peace and security in her new
and humble life. She became a great favorite with
Madam Ward, and by her diligent attention to everything
that was shown to her, bade fair to learn the
trade by which she hoped to earn her livelihood in a
very short time.</p>

<p>There was not a girl in Madam Ward’s employ
who did not love the beautiful young apprentice, who
never assumed any airs of superiority, although her
every act and word proclaimed her a true lady.</p>

<p>She had a bright smile and a pleasant word for
every one; and of the sorrows gnawing at her heart
she never complained, even to Jenny. But the burden
of her secret grief was telling upon her, and one night
after the girls had taken their departure, Madam
Ward said in confidence to her sister:</p>

<p>“I am afraid our little Maggie will not be able to
stand the confinement of a workroom. I can see her
failing day by day. She has not been accustomed
to such a life, it is plain to be seen. I shall give her
something to do that will take her out into the air
to-morrow if the day is fine. Let me see&mdash;what
errand can I send her upon? Oh, I have it, she shall
take this check to the bank and bring me the money
for it. By the way, I did not tell you that Mr. Stuart
had sent me the amount of his wife’s bill&mdash;here it is&mdash;a
check for two hundred dollars, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Madam Ward’s voice ceased suddenly, for, on<span class="pagenum">[276]</span>
chancing to raise her eyes from the check she was
holding in her hand, she saw that the room had another
occupant besides her sister and herself.</p>

<p>“Why, Mrs. Neville, I did not hear you enter;
pray pardon me, and be seated.”</p>

<p>Madam drew forward an armchair for her wealthy
customer, and Clara Neville accepted the invitation,
laughing heartily at madam’s look of dismay.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, my dear madam, I must plead guilty
to the crime of eavesdropping. I was so charmed to
hear you speak so kindly of one of your poor little
working girls&mdash;won’t you please tell me about this little
Maggie?”</p>

<p>Madam Ward was pleased at the interest Mrs.
Neville appeared to take in the subject, and at once
proceeded to tell all she knew of Maggie Gordon&mdash;which
was nothing beyond the fact that Maggie had
come there with Jenny Mason to learn the dressmaking
and that she had evidently been reared in a higher
sphere of life, as madam expressed herself, and lastly
that she was growing paler and thinner every day for
want of outdoor exercise.</p>

<p>Mrs. Neville listened with an expression of deep interest
and sympathy on her face, exclaiming, when
madam had concluded:</p>

<p>“Poor little one! I should like to see her. You are to
send her down to the bank to-morrow, you say, or I
should drive down here expressly to have a glimpse
at her, you have interested me so in her story. Of
course, I should come ostensibly on some errand concerning
the work you are doing for me&mdash;as I came
in reality to-night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[277]</span></p>

<p>“You can do so still, Mrs. Neville. Maggie shall
go to the bank about one o’clock. The business will
not occupy more than two hours of her time, and
during the rest of the day you can see her,” replied
madam, failing to notice the quick flash of triumph
that glittered in the lady’s eyes at this piece of information.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Mrs. Neville took her departure,
promising to call on the morrow; but when
the car door was closed upon her she laughed aloud,
muttering, as she glanced back to the house she had
just left:</p>

<p>“If you see either your pretty Maggie or your two
hundred dollars after you send her on that errand to-morrow,
it will be because my plan proves a failure,
which I think is scarcely likely to be the case.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">IN THE TOILS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>All day long, while the eyes of her humble friend
Jenny and the rest of her shopmates were on her,
Iris preserved a calm and almost happy exterior; but
when night came, and she lay awake by the sleeping
Jenny’s side, then, indeed, the girl’s young heart was
like to break, and the God in whom she trusted alone
knew what she suffered.</p>

<p>It was a close, sultry day in early springtime, and
Iris found great difficulty in breathing, but she never
once raised the thick brown veil that concealed her
face, having a constant horror of meeting Charles
Broughton, or some of the sunny-day friends who
might recognize in this pale little working girl the
happy Iris of other days.</p>

<p>By walking slowly she reached the bank at last,
but was unable to get her check cashed immediately,
as there chanced to be quite a number of people to
be served before her.</p>

<p>One gentleman, noting the weary attitude in which
she stood, awaiting her turn, placed a chair for her
behind a large, fluted column near the paying teller’s
window, where she might sit comfortably and partly
concealed from the throng of people around her.</p>

<p>While Iris was seated in this place, two gentlemen,
leaning against the column behind which she was ensconced,
and totally ignorant of her proximity, were
conversing in low, guarded tones, every word uttered
being distinctly audible to Iris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[279]</span></p>

<p>She was about to cough, or make some sound that
would warn the gentlemen of her presence, when some
words spoken by one of them caused her to pause.</p>

<p>She had recognized the voice of Gerald Dare; and
Dare had mentioned a name the very sound of which
sent the blood tingling through her veins like wildfire.</p>

<p>“I am greatly surprised at the information you have
just imparted to me,” Gerald’s companion said, in answer
to something the former had been telling him;
and Gerald hastily resumed: “But the information is
perfectly correct, I assure you. I was somewhat surprised
myself, on first hearing the news, although I
don’t know why St. John should not marry old Hilton’s
heiress&mdash;the black-browed Isabel is eminently
more suited to him than that pretty little Iris could
possibly have been. Sad affair&mdash;that of little Iris,
was it not?”</p>

<p>“I never heard the truth of the girl’s story, Dare,
beyond some vague rumors that she had left Mr. Hilton’s
home, and that she was not his own daughter.
I never had the pleasure of meeting Miss Iris but once,
and then I thought her a charming little lady. What
was the trouble, anyhow?”</p>

<p>Leaning slightly forward in her chair, with a face
that was like a mask of marble behind the thick folds
of her veil, Iris listened for Gerald Dare’s answer,
her heart throbbing so wildly that she half feared its
loud pulsations would betray her.</p>

<p>She could hear the long sigh with which Gerald
Dare prefaced his answer to his friend’s question, and<span class="pagenum">[280]</span>
then every word he uttered pierced her heart, and
imprinted itself in characters of fire on her brain.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say that the girl is unworthy of
sympathy. I confess I was once sadly smitten with
her charms, and when it leaked out that she had left
her old home, I would not have believed any one who
had dared tell me there was any guilty motive for
her flight. I had my eyes opened to the truth in a
very short time, however.</p>

<p>“You know Broughton, do you not? Yes, I mean
Charley Broughton; well, what will you say of Miss
Iris when I tell you that I found her at the house in
Lexington Avenue. Ah, you wince, my friend; probably
the mention of this house recalls the memory
of many bright dollars lost inside its walls.</p>

<p>“Well, it was there I came upon Miss Iris, talking
confidentially with Broughton, in that gentleman’s
own private rooms.</p>

<p>“I was shocked beyond power of expression, and
very nearly succeeded in incurring my host’s enmity
by a too evident betrayal of my feelings on the subject.
A couple of days after the encounter I fell
across St. John at the club, and told him where I had
seen the girl every one fancied him in love with. I
know you think it was unmanly of me, but you see
I owed St. John an old grudge, and I think I paid it
then, in full.</p>

<p>“He looked like a dead man for a moment, and I
could see him shiver as if some one had struck him
a heavy blow; but he could not have taken the matter
so much to heart as I believed at the time, or society<span class="pagenum">[281]</span>
would not to-day be canvassing the probability of his
early marriage with Isabel Hilton.”</p>

<p>At this moment another gentleman joined the
speakers, and the subject of St. John and his loves
was dropped for the time.</p>

<p>It would be a task beyond our feeble powers to
describe the feelings of Iris at the time.</p>

<p>She made no sound, nor gave any outward sign
of the torture she was enduring, nor did she give
herself entirely up to the deadly weakness that was
creeping over her.</p>

<p>She remembered Madam Ward’s check, and watched
her opportunity to present it.</p>

<p>This accomplished, she left the bank building with
slow and faltering steps, having first concealed the
money in her bosom with a vague fear that she would
not long have her senses, or the power to take care
of it.</p>

<p>Just outside the door of the bank the girl was
obliged to raise her veil, as she seemed literally stifling,
and the instant she had done so a lady, who had been
seated in a motor car at the entrance to the bank,
some fifteen minutes before Iris emerged from the
building, stepped out of the vehicle and approached
her, exclaiming in a soft, well-modulated voice: “I
beg your pardon, but are you Maggie Gordon, in the
employ of Madam Ward, of Forty-first Street? Yes?
How fortunate. I have just driven down from madam’s
on the chance of meeting you. Madam told me
she gave you a sample of silk to match on your way
home. The silk is for my dress, you know, and I
chanced to remember that I have two or three yards<span class="pagenum">[282]</span>
of the same material at home, so that it would be
only a useless piece of extravagance to purchase more.
If you will step into the car and drive home with me
I will give you the silk, and send my chauffeur with
you to madam’s.”</p>

<p>Iris merely bowed in token that she was at Clara
Neville’s service, and followed the latter to the
machine, volunteering no remark as the vehicle drove
away, and scarcely once glancing toward her companion,
but lying back with closed eyes in a corner
of the limousine, with the brown veil again concealing
her white, pained face.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">ISABEL’S BETROTHAL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The handsome residence of Oscar Hilton was ablaze
with lights from basement to attic, and from the long
parlors issued the sound of merry dance music. It
was Isabel’s birthday, and Isabel’s dear five hundred
friends had been invited to do honor to the occasion.</p>

<p>It must have been almost, if not quite, eleven o’clock,
and the festivities were at their height, when a servant
made his way through the dancers to the place where
his master stood, with such a look of alarm on his
face, that every one who chanced to see it knew there
was something wrong, or some sad news to be imparted
to their host. Hilton himself turned white as
death as he saw the man coming toward him.</p>

<p>A hush fell upon the assembled guests, and at this
most inopportune moment the music ceased, and one
could plainly hear the beating of the rain against the
windows, one of those sudden storms peculiar to early
springtime having arisen unknown to the dancers.</p>

<p>The servant was speaking in low, cautious tones
to his master, but some of his words came plainly to
the ears of the bystanders, among whom were St.
John and Isabel.</p>

<p>“Miss Iris is outside, sir, an’ she’s sick, I think,
fainted dead away. She’s drenched through with the
rain&mdash;and&mdash;and, oh, sir, I think she’s a-dyin’. She
just came up the stoop a-holdin’ by the rails, an’ when
I opened the door she cried so faintly, sir, ‘mother!<span class="pagenum">[284]</span>
mother!’ an’ fell as if dead at my feet before I could
catch her. I laid her in the reception room, sir&mdash;was
that right?&mdash;an’ I thought it best to tell you before I
frightened Mrs. Hilton.”</p>

<p>“Quite right, Peter; I will attend to the girl myself,”
whispered Mr. Hilton, unconscious that any other ear
than his own had caught Peter’s words.</p>

<p>Peter hurried from the room with his eyes suspiciously
moistened and red; he had loved the gentle
Iris very dearly.</p>

<p>Mr. Hilton shortly followed him, pausing first to
make a polite apology to his guests for the necessity
which obliged him to tear himself away from them
for a few moments only.</p>

<p>From what Isabel had overheard, she knew that Iris
had returned ill, and in trouble, at this late hour, and
her eyes instinctively sought those of the man upon
whose arm she leaned.</p>

<p>His face was white and set, and his lips pressed
themselves tightly together, but he did not avoid her
gaze.</p>

<p>He drew her hand closer within his arm, and led
her to a spot a little distance removed from the rest
of the company.</p>

<p>“Isabel,” he said gently, as if he had read aright
the fear in her eyes, “you are my promised wife, and
Iris has sinned beyond the possibility of forgiveness&mdash;you
need not fear that I will give her one thought
that would be a wrong to you. I know your father
will deal gently with her, but you, Isabel, you who
have loved her as a sister almost all her life, you will<span class="pagenum">[285]</span>
be kind to her if she comes to you, penitent and suffering;
will you not promise me this, Isabel, my wife?”</p>

<p>He spoke the last two words with a peculiar emphasis,
as if trying to impress on his heart and brain
that she was really to bear this relationship to him.</p>

<p>She smiled up into his face, while tears dimmed her
lustrous eyes as she answered:</p>

<p>“Were she the vilest sinner on earth, I would receive
her gladly&mdash;joyfully, and do everything in my
power to reclaim her.”</p>

<p>As Isabel uttered these words, Chester St. John bent
suddenly over her and touched his lips gently to her
forehead.</p>

<p>It was the first time he had ever caressed her, and
the warm blood crept into her dusky cheeks until they
rivaled the crimson of the rose at her breast, but she
knew that the kiss was given only for Iris’ sake, and
her heart grew hard and bitter toward that hapless
girl.</p>

<p>“She shall not return to this house though she die
of starvation on the street,” was Isabel’s thought, and
at the very first opportunity that offered she stole
quietly from the room and made her way to the apartment
where she expected to find her father and the
unhappy Iris.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A CRUEL SUSPICION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Oh, madam, I cannot work any longer; something
terrible has happened to Maggie; I have felt so uneasy
all day about her, and now, see, it is almost night,
and she has not yet returned. I must go and look
for her; my hands tremble so that I can no longer
hold my needle.”</p>

<p>The speaker was Jenny Mason, and the time almost
evening of the day on which Iris had been sent to the
bank by Madam Ward.</p>

<p>“I am beginning to grow the least bit uneasy myself,”
exclaimed madam, while Jenny waited for her
permission to quit work. “I think it probable that
Mrs. Neville is detaining her; you know, Jenny, that
Mrs. Neville said she should probably meet Maggie
at the bank and drive her home. If this is the case I
shall scold Maggie severely, for she should certainly
know better than to keep me in this suspense all this
time. You may go, Jenny, but I do not think there
is any cause for alarm. Maggie is certainly no baby;
she is fully capable of taking care of herself.”</p>

<p>Jenny did not wait to hear any further words from
her employer. Her heart was sick with forebodings
and fears for the safety of the friend she loved, and
she left the shop in Forty-first Street looking like a
little ghost.</p>

<p>After Jenny’s departure, Madam Ward grew more
uneasy with every passing moment, and at last, when
darkness began to settle over the city, and the girls<span class="pagenum">[287]</span>
were making ready for departure, she called Emma
Henry to her, and asked the latter to go to Mrs.
Neville’s residence and see if the missing girl was still
there.</p>

<p>Emma started upon the errand gladly, for she could
hardly have slept that night without being satisfied of
Maggie’s safety.</p>

<p>She had not been gone ten minutes when madam,
whose face was pressed against the windowpane, uttered
an exclamation of intense relief.</p>

<p>Mrs. Neville’s car was drawing up before the door.</p>

<p>“At last Maggie has come,” she said, half angrily,
and hurried down to open the door herself in her impatience;
but Maggie had not come.</p>

<p>Mrs. Neville herself stood on the threshold, looking
flushed and angry.</p>

<p>“I declare, madam,” this lady began, “I shall never
interest myself again in a shop girl. I took your pretty
Maggie home with me to-day, and treated her like a
lady, and here I find the silk I gave her to bring to
you hidden behind my vestibule door. You know that
I am in a great hurry for my dress, so I thought I
would ride down and give you the silk, as I have other
business in this direction. I do not quite like your
favorite, Maggie. She was laboring under intense excitement
to-day, and I confess her conduct displeased
me. She refused to be driven back here in my car,
and I think she went to meet some lover. I hope&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Neville never finished her sentence, for
madam was wringing her hands, and weeping violently.</p>

<p>“It cuts me to the heart to believe that Maggie is
a thief,” she was sobbing, and Mrs. Neville smiled<span class="pagenum">[288]</span>
behind her embroidered handkerchief at the success
of her cruel plans, while she affected to sympathize
with the too trusting mistress of the unworthy girl.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During the short drive from the bank to the residence
of Clara Neville, Iris preserved an unbroken
silence. The shock of the revelation to which she had
been an unwilling listener seemed to have deprived
her of thought or action.</p>

<p>Arriving at her home, Mrs. Neville requested Iris
to follow her to a room on the second floor&mdash;her own
boudoir&mdash;a pretty little apartment furnished in the
gay, bright colors the widow loved.</p>

<p>“You had better be seated, girl, for I have a few
words to say to you, and it makes me nervous to see
you standing.”</p>

<p>“If you have any message for madam,” replied
Iris, “I beg you will tell me at once, Mrs. Neville,
as I am anxious to return with the money I have in
charge for her. I am afraid she will be anxious if I
am delayed a moment longer than is necessary.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Neville laughed mockingly at the girl’s impatience
to be gone, and, sinking languidly into the
nearest chair, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I am very much afraid madam will be forced to
endure the pangs of anxiety for some little time to
come. Stay,” as Iris made an involuntary movement
toward the door, “I do not choose that you shall leave
this room until you have answered a few questions I
desire to put to you. In the first place&mdash;what are
you to Charles Broughton, my intended husband?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Neville had sprung to her feet as she uttered<span class="pagenum">[289]</span>
the last words, and placed herself between Iris and the
door, looking straight into the girl’s wide, dilated eyes,
and noting the look of horror that crept into the blue
depths at her sudden question.</p>

<p>She waited a moment for Iris’ answer, but the
girl could not speak, and Mrs. Neville was more than
even convinced of the truth of her suspicions.</p>

<p>We will spare the reader a repetition of the harsh,
unwomanly language now uttered by the jealous
woman, and the cruel epithets she applied to our unfortunate
heroine.</p>

<p>For one moment only Iris stood listening, and shivering
like a frail flower in a winter gale, and then
the faintness that had been growing upon her all day
overcame her, and she lost all knowledge of her sufferings
in a blessed unconsciousness, falling to the
floor without a moan or sigh, and lying at Clara Neville’s
feet like one dead.</p>

<p>The widow knelt beside Iris and unfastened the
bosom of her dress, and Madam Ward’s two hundred
dollars fell out upon the carpet. She picked it up
and placed it in her own pocket, smiling triumphantly
as she did so.</p>

<p>At this moment the sound as of some one breathing
startled her, and looking up quickly she encountered
the astonished gaze of Charles Broughton, who had
entered the room unobserved, his footsteps making no
sound on the velvet pile of the carpet.</p>

<p>He was the first to break the embarrassing silence.</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of this scene, Clara, and
what brought this girl here?”</p>

<p>There was nothing of tenderness in his eyes or his<span class="pagenum">[290]</span>
voice, as he motioned carelessly toward the senseless
girl, but Clara attributed his pallor to anxiety for her&mdash;Iris&mdash;and
this belief increased her rage and jealousy
tenfold.</p>

<p>She reproached him in bitter and cutting language
for his supposed infidelity, and told him the circumstance
of her having seen Iris leave his house on
Lexington Avenue.</p>

<p>Her explanation of the scene Broughton had surprised
her in was simple and plausible.</p>

<p>“This girl came here to get a piece of silk from me
for her employer. I recognized her as your friend,
and my temper got the better of my reason.</p>

<p>“She fainted when I told her of the wrong she was
doing me&mdash;your promised wife&mdash;and as this fact in
itself would have convinced me of her friendship for
you, I confess I was bitterly angry; and in my desire
to be revenged upon this little pauper who has succeeded
in destroying my happiness, I would have sent
her out of this house without one penny of the two
hundred dollars she had just taken from the bank
for Madam Ward.</p>

<p>“Now you know all the truth, Charles, and here and
now I want you to choose between us&mdash;this pauper&mdash;this
dressmaker’s apprentice&mdash;and myself.”</p>

<p>The widow’s face was actually ablaze with anger,
and Broughton, knowing the need he had for her
fortune, resolved to conciliate her at all hazards, regardless
of the injury he must do his own child.</p>

<p>“My dear Clara,” he began, encircling her form
with one arm despite her feeble effort to resist him,
“you have caused yourself a world of unnecessary<span class="pagenum">[291]</span>
trouble and heartache. So far from loving this girl
am I, that I may safely assure you the feeling I
cherish for her is one more closely approaching to
hatred. I told you on the occasion of my first meeting
with her in the home of your seamstress, Jenny Mason,
that her face reminded me of a woman whom I considered
my deadliest enemy.</p>

<p>“I have since discovered that she is the daughter of
this enemy, and I have to revenge myself on the
mother through the child. Some day, my own Clara,
when you are my wife, and our interests are identical,
I shall tell you all the story of my past; but you have
assured me over and over again that you trusted me
implicitly, and now is the time to prove your sincerity.
I shall test it to the utmost, Clara, and&mdash;but see, the
girl is reviving&mdash;keep the money in your own possession
until we can venture to send it to the owner
anonymously, and deny all knowledge of it should she,”&mdash;with
a careless motion of his head toward the figure
on the floor&mdash;“discover its loss before leaving the
house, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>At this moment there was a hasty knock at the door,
and the voice of a servant outside begging the privilege
of a few words with her mistress.</p>

<p>Mrs. Neville left the room to ascertain the cause
of this interruption.</p>

<p>As she passed out of the room, Iris opened wide
her blue eyes and raised herself on her elbow, looking
around her in bewilderment.</p>

<p>The instant her eyes fell on Broughton, who stood
coolly looking down upon her, she remembered the
scene through which she had lately passed, and arose<span class="pagenum">[292]</span>
to her feet as rapidly as her feeble strength would
allow, disdaining the aid of his proffered hand.</p>

<p>The man did not wait for her to speak, but placing
a chair for her, almost forced her to be seated.</p>

<p>“You must listen to me, my dear,” he began, in the
cold, stern voice she remembered so well. “I know all
about the ordeal you have just gone through, and I
have taught Mrs. Neville her error. Are you not tired
of the life you have been living since we parted, Iris?
Are you not ready to accept the offer I made you on
the occasion of our last meeting? I have not interfered
with you since then, trusting that time would
show you the folly of your conduct, and now I am
ready to renew the offer I then made you. Will you
come with me to my home?”</p>

<p>Iris had by this time recovered the power of speech,
and she would not allow Broughton to proceed further.</p>

<p>“What does your offer mean for me&mdash;a life of
even greater misery than I have yet endured&mdash;a life
I blush to name? Dear Heaven, do you know the
shame I have suffered this day, to hear myself branded
as a creature unfit for honest women to notice! You
say you have been a convict, and I know you are now
a gambler and the associate of gamblers; yet acknowledge
me as your daughter and I will be your slave.
I can bear anything but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Broughton at this moment checked the speaker by
a gesture so fierce and determined that she shrank
from him in actual fear.</p>

<p>“Cease, girl, and never dare to mention the word
convict again in my presence. What you ask of me
is impossible for me to grant. Come with me to my<span class="pagenum">[293]</span>
home. Let the world say of you what it will, you will
at least be secure from want. More than this I cannot
do for you. Refuse the offer, and before the dawn of
another day the woman who now employs you to work
for her shall charge you with theft, and accuse you
as a thief before the world.”</p>

<p>Iris had thrown herself before him in a kneeling
attitude, and was clasping his knees in an agony of
supplication.</p>

<p>At his last words the girl sprang quickly to her feet,
repeating in accents of supreme horror:</p>

<p>“A thief, a thief! Great Heaven, what can you
mean?”</p>

<p>The footsteps of Mrs. Neville were heard returning
along the hallway now, and Broughton whispered hurriedly:</p>

<p>“I mean just what I have said. You shall be accused
of theft unless you do my bidding. The two
hundred dollars you had in your possession when you
entered this house have been taken from you. If you
go back to Madam Ward without the money, do you
think she will believe the improbable story you would
be obliged to tell to account for its loss? Think over
my offer. I shall return to you in a couple of hours,
during which time you shall remain in this room alone.
Ah, Clara, my dear,” as the widow appeared in the
doorway, “I was just telling this young lady you would
permit her to remain here until she recovers from the
effects of her swoon,” and before Iris could open her
lips to speak, Broughton had drawn Mrs. Neville with
him out of the room, and locked the door on the
outside, leaving Iris for the time a prisoner.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_LVII">CHAPTER LVII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">HOMELESS AND ALONE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It never occurred to Iris to attempt an escape from
Mrs. Neville’s boudoir, until such time as Broughton
saw fit to release her.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock that night Broughton reëntered the
room.</p>

<p>“Well, have you concluded to accept my offer?” he
asked sternly, and the sound of his voice had the effect
of rousing the girl as nothing else could have done.</p>

<p>“I shall never accept your offer. Let me go, sir;
I had rather be thrown into prison for a theft of which
I am innocent than buy my freedom at such a price.”</p>

<p>“It will be a noble revenge, my dear, to doom the
child of my betrayer to the same fate I suffered at her
hands. Go, now, it is after ten o’clock, and Madam
Ward will be terribly alarmed, you know.”</p>

<p>He moved aside for Iris to pass out as he concluded,
and the girl went out into the street alone,
knowing it would be useless to appeal to him again
or to demand the return of madam’s money.</p>

<p>“Oh, what shall I do! I dare not face Madam
Ward, nor can I go to Jenny; it would kill me to see
a look of distrust in the eyes of the girl who has
loved and trusted me always, and who is now my only
friend. Father in heaven, look down on Thy most
wretched child to-night, and direct her what to do;
guide her to some haven of refuge, or she will die
in the streets.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[295]</span></p>

<p>She finally determined to go home to her mother.</p>

<p>Her hand was on the bell knob of the door of her
home when the most cruel memory that had yet
dawned upon her made her pause in the act of ringing.
Chester St. John was surely in those lighted parlors&mdash;an
honored guest, and the betrothed husband of Isabel,
while she, whom he once loved, was an outcast and
homeless, alone in the darkness of the night and the
storm.</p>

<p>This bitter memory was as the last straw that broke
the camel’s back, and when Peter opened the door,
her lips could frame no other word than that piteous
cry for “mother” ere the tortured brain once more
gave way.</p>

<p>She did not faint, or entirely lose consciousness, but
a deadly sickness robbed her limbs of their strength,
and Peter was obliged to lift her into a little room
across the hallway, ere he went to acquaint Mr. Hilton
with the fact of her presence.</p>

<p>Iris would have made her own way to her mother’s
apartments when he had departed on this mission, but
it seemed that her limbs were palsied, and refused to
obey her will, or even to bear her slight weight when
she made an attempt to stand on her feet.</p>

<p>“Was it death that was coming to her?”</p>

<p>A happy light sprang into her weary eyes as this
sweet hope dawned upon her, and she murmured in a
tone loud enough to reach the ears of Mr. Hilton,
who had just entered the room:</p>

<p>“Mother, you will let me stay with you till it is
over; you will not turn your child out into the streets
to die?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[296]</span></p>

<p>“Good heavens, girl! Why do you talk of dying?
You are raving; what has happened to you, and why
are you here?”</p>

<p>The last words, harshly and coldly spoken, showed
the girl that she had little mercy to expect at the hands
of her mother’s husband.</p>

<p>“Let me see my mother&mdash;I am ill&mdash;dying, I think&mdash;and
I&mdash;I have no one else in all the world,” she said
faintly, holding to the back of a chair for support as
she arose from the couch on which Peter had laid her.</p>

<p>“I cannot grant your request, Iris,” he said coldly.
“By your own conduct you have forfeited your right
to hold any manner of intercourse with my wife. If
you are ill I will give you some money, and send Peter
to take you to your lodgings, but this is all I can
promise&mdash;ah, Isabel, my daughter, why did you follow
me here? Go back to your guests.”</p>

<p>The bright head of Iris had drooped lower and
lower while Hilton spoke until it rested on the back
of the chair, but as he addressed Isabel, she&mdash;Iris&mdash;raised
her eyes, with the vague hope that the girl
whom she had loved as a sister would say some word
in her favor.</p>

<p>“Isabel, I have only asked to see my mother,” she
faltered, but Isabel retorted coldly:</p>

<p>“I fully agree with papa that it is impossible. How
could you come here to-night, Iris, when you know
how the world is talking of your disgraceful conduct.
You must go away quietly&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Isabel!”</p>

<p>The voice that had spoken the name proceeded from
the doorway, where Chester St. John was standing,<span class="pagenum">[297]</span>
gazing into the room with eyes that were dark with
scorn and anger, and a face white as that of Iris
herself.</p>

<p>“Chester,” Isabel exclaimed, with an air of injured
innocence and a reproachful glance toward the motionless
figure in the doorway, “you think we are cruel
and harsh to Iris; but you cannot understand that in
denying her request to-night we were seeking to spare
her the bitter knowledge that her own mother absolutely
refuses to admit her, or to speak to her if she
were dying. Is not this the truth, papa?”</p>

<p>“It is certainly true, St. John,” he answered. “I
would have spared this unfortunate girl, had such a
thing been at all possible; but my wife positively declines
to have anything to do with her daughter now,
or at any time in the future. Mrs. Hilton is even
weaker to-night than usual, and&mdash;but,” with a sudden
assumption of pride and offended dignity, “I do not
really know why I am making these explanations to
you, St. John; as my daughter’s accepted suitor, the
affairs of this girl cannot concern you; and I think
you will do me the justice to confess that I, who have
fed and clothed and sheltered Iris Tresilian until she
left my home of her own accord, and for what purpose
you know&mdash;am fully capable of dealing justly
with her now.”</p>

<p>“I understand your reproof, sir, and while I acknowledge
that I have no right to dictate to you in
this matter, I will still beg leave to say a word in
the interests of common humanity. Had I never
looked upon Iris Tresilian’s face I should still protest
against a young creature like her being sent out<span class="pagenum">[298]</span>
on such a night, unprotected and alone. If she has
sinned&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>At the last words of St. John, “If she has sinned,”
spoken in a sorrowful tone that told how firmly he
believed in her guilt, all her soul seemed to rise in
passionate rebellion, and with the false strength despair
sometimes lends, Iris advanced toward the group
near the doorway, and stood before them, a little,
solitary figure, with white, set features, whose immobility
would have been actually startling but for the
convulsive twitching of the muscles of the colorless
lips, and the large, blue eyes dilated like those of a
hunted stag.</p>

<p>“Of what sin am I accused, Mr. Hilton?” she asked.
“For what crime does my mother condemn me so
harshly?” Then turning suddenly to St. John, before
Hilton could answer: “I left this gentleman’s home
because he taught me that I had no claim upon him&mdash;that
I, who had believed myself his daughter, was the
child of an unworthy father whose name I should
blush to bear. I went forth from this house to earn
my own bread, and since that time I have done nothing
of which I need be ashamed, nor&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She came to a sudden stop here, while for a moment
the color grew deeper and deeper in her face, and
then faded utterly, leaving her again deadly pale.</p>

<p>She had thought of Gerald Dare’s words, and the
suspicions her presence in the house of Charles
Broughton had awakened.</p>

<p>Her sudden hesitation and confusion, and the ineradicable
flush of shame that had dyed her cheeks
at this cruel memory, seemed to contradict her previous<span class="pagenum">[299]</span>
assertion of innocence, and to shake the faith
new-born in Chester St. John’s heart.</p>

<p>At Iris’ first words Oscar Hilton had trembled lest
there should be something said concerning the forged
letter, and he now seized this moment of the girl’s
embarrassment to turn the drift of the conversation
into a new channel.</p>

<p>“My poor child,” he ejaculated, in a tone of well-feigned
sympathy, “do not seek to defend your conduct.
Unhappily we have all been made acquainted
with the manner in which you have passed your time
since leaving my protection. If&mdash;as you say&mdash;you are
innocent, will you be good enough to tell us what
you are to the noted gambler and roué, Charles
Broughton?”</p>

<p>At this coarse and rude question Iris started violently,
and looked into the face of the speaker with
an expression of actual terror, fearing for the moment
that he had in some manner learned the secret of
Broughton’s identity.</p>

<p>That one swift glance into his eyes reassured her.
She knew that he shared, or pretended to share, the
common belief that Broughton was her lover, and
she dared say nothing to undeceive him.</p>

<p>“I can tell you nothing at present, but some time
you will know all, and learn how deeply you have
wronged me. My mother will forgive me then, and
bitterly regret her cruelty.”</p>

<p>She took a step toward the door as she concluded,
keeping her eyes turned resolutely away from the face
of Chester St. John, lest the sight of it should rob<span class="pagenum">[300]</span>
her of the last remnant of strength she was struggling
so hard to maintain.</p>

<p>Isabel had thrown herself into an easy-chair near
the door, and was holding her handkerchief to her
face as if deeply affected by the scene, while Oscar
Hilton was perhaps the most excited of all the little
group.</p>

<p>He feared to detain Iris lest something should be
said to betray his plot, and he dared not let her go
forth alone lest St. John should follow to protect
her, and thus learn all the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. Hilton himself was puzzled to account for the
mystery of Iris’ connection with Broughton, for, from
his own experience of his wife’s beautiful daughter,
he knew her to be pure as the untrodden snow, and
utterly incapable of the sin of which she stood accused.</p>

<p>Whatever the cause of the singular emotion she
had betrayed at his chance mention of Broughton’s
name, he&mdash;Hilton&mdash;was satisfied with the effect upon
St. John, seeing as he did that the latter’s newly awakened
faith in the girl he had loved so devotedly was
again shattered.</p>

<p>Mr. Hilton made haste to respond to Iris’ last words
before St. John had time to speak, if such had been
that gentleman’s intention.</p>

<p>“My dear child, if you can prove to us that we have
wronged you, I, for one, shall be happy, both for your
own sake and that of the woman who bears my name,
your mother; and now, Iris, I shall appropriate the
car of one of my guests to take you to your home, as
you are looking weak and ill, and it is nearly midnight.<span class="pagenum">[301]</span>
St. John, I may have your machine for this purpose,
may I not?”</p>

<p>At this direct appeal, Chester&mdash;who had crossed
the room, and stood leaning against the low marble
mantel, with his eyes bent on the floor, and his face
pale with an agony he did not endeavor to conceal&mdash;advanced
quickly to the spot on which Iris stood, with
a look in his eyes that filled Oscar Hilton with fear.</p>

<p>St. John was about to ask Iris a question which
would have betrayed him.</p>

<p>He was about to ask her where was the man whose
fortune she had left her home to follow, that he might
have constituted himself her champion and avenger,
had he discovered that this lover had basely deserted
or deceived her.</p>

<p>At this moment light footsteps were heard approaching
the door, and a sweet, girlish voice calling gayly:</p>

<p>“Chester! Isabel! Where are you, truants?” as
the door was thrown open unceremoniously to admit
a fairylike vision in the person of pretty, golden-haired
Grace St. John, who had been Iris Tresilian’s
most intimate and best-loved friend.</p>

<p>“Ah, brother Chester, how wicked of you to keep
Belle all this time from her friends; we shall be
obliged&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Grace’s merry voice ceased all of a sudden, for her
eyes had fallen on the pale, drooped face of Iris, and
although Chester made an involuntary movement as
if to step between them&mdash;a movement Iris understood
but too well, the impulsive Grace sprang quickly to
the side of the outcast, and clasped her white arms
around the latter’s neck, crying joyously:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[302]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Iris, darling, I am so glad to see you; I have
missed you so&mdash;I shall be so happy now that you
have come home, but, Iris, dear, why do you sob so
bitterly?”</p>

<p>At the first word of kindness, and the first touch
of Grace’s caressing hands, Iris had broken down utterly,
and her slender frame was racked with hoarse,
convulsive sobs that were pitiful to hear.</p>

<p>Mr. Hilton addressed St. John in a harsh, imperative
tone:</p>

<p>“Take your sister and Isabel back to the parlors
while I attend to Iris. This is no scene for either
of them.”</p>

<p>Iris heard these words, and put aside Grace’s clinging
arms.</p>

<p>“Let me go, Gracie, dear; I am no fit associate for
you now,” she said sadly and bitterly, walking with
tottering steps toward the door as she spoke; but
Grace St. John reached it before her and prevented
her egress.</p>

<p>“Wait, Iris; I must understand this scene,” she said
firmly, her pretty white-rose face growing paler than
its wont, and her blue eyes glancing reproachfully
from face to face. “I do not understand why you
left your home, Iris. I only know that some great
sorrow or misfortune has fallen on you, and changed
you almost beyond recognition. I have loved you like
a sister since you and I were little children, and yet
you say you are no fit associate for me now, Iris!
What do you mean? Why do you speak of leaving
this house at such an hour, darling? If these doors
are closed against you, you shall come home with me.<span class="pagenum">[303]</span>
Don’t shudder and shake your head; I tell you, Iris,
there is no barrier strong enough to separate us, unless&mdash;unless”&mdash;the
girl hesitated, while a faint tinge of
color crept into her white face&mdash;“unless you had
sinned beyond even a mother’s forgiveness, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The cold, metallic tones of Oscar Hilton’s voice here
interposed:</p>

<p>“Miss St. John, it grieves me beyond the power of
words to express, but I am forced to tell you the truth,
that this scene may be no longer prolonged. Iris
Tresilian has sinned beyond a mother’s forgiveness.
My wife has cast her out of her heart, and forbidden
me to receive her again in my home. She&mdash;&mdash;” A
suppressed cry from Isabel checked the words he was
about to have added, and, following the glance of his
daughter’s eyes, he saw the cause of her alarm.</p>

<p>The door near which Grace and Iris were standing
had been pushed softly open, and Evelyn Hilton was
crossing the threshold, moving slowly, with her hands
clasped in front of her and her eyes bent downward.</p>

<p>She was attired in a long, loose white wrapper, and
her fair hair, escaped from its fastenings, hung far
below her waist, giving her a singularly weird and
ghostlike appearance.</p>

<p>Oscar Hilton’s face grew white as marble, and
great beads of perspiration stood out thickly on his
forehead.</p>

<p>“She is asleep!” he whispered.</p>

<p>“Not a sound for your lives. A sudden awakening
would cause her death&mdash;I have been warned.”</p>

<p>This was indeed true. Mrs. Hilton was a confirmed
somnambulist, and her doctor feared that a sudden<span class="pagenum">[304]</span>
awakening from one of these spells would sooner or
later prove fatal.</p>

<p>“Steal quietly out of the room, and leave her alone
with me,” said Hilton, in the same low whisper; but
even while he spoke he saw that this would be impossible,
for the sleepwalker had paused directly in
the doorway, and stood in such a position that it would
have been impossible for any one to pass out without
touching her, and the very lightest touch would have
awakened her.</p>

<p>There was a moment of intense silence, broken only
by the heavy breathing of the sleeping woman.</p>

<p>Iris trembled like a leaf in a storm, and was scarcely
conscious that it was Chester St. John’s firm hand
that had forced her into an easy-chair, against the
back of which he was now leaning, with his face hidden
in his hands.</p>

<p>Presently the lips of the somnambulist opened, and
she spoke, slowly and distinctly:</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me to do it, Oscar; I’ve been a bad,
unfeeling mother always, but I cannot do this thing;
it is such a cruel letter&mdash;it will make Chester St. John
despise her&mdash;I can copy her handwriting&mdash;yes&mdash;I
know&mdash;but to say she left her home for an unworthy
lover&mdash;while I know that all her heart is given to him&mdash;to
Chester&mdash;no! no! Oscar! Don’t threaten to betray
my secret&mdash;I will write&mdash;anything&mdash;anything you
dictate&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Tears were streaming down the poor, wan cheeks
of the unfortunate woman now, while Iris with difficulty
checked her own wild sobbing, and Chester St.
John whispered hoarsely:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[305]</span></p>

<p>“What can this mean!” And dropping on his
knees, weak as a fainting woman, hid his face on the
arm of the chair in which Iris reclined.</p>

<p>Oscar Hilton had crept noiselessly to his daughter’s
side, and was pressing his hand firmly on her shoulder
to prevent her from making any outcry; for, base and
worldly as this man was, he loved his wife with all
the strength of which his selfish nature was capable,
and bore even this betrayal of his baseness rather than
silence her at the risk of her life.</p>

<p>Again there was a moment of silence, while the
fingers of the sleeper made the motions of writing,
slowly and carefully, pausing often, and bending her
head as if to study some written page before her.</p>

<p>She seemed to have finished at last, all to the signing
of the name, and this she repeated aloud:</p>

<p>“Iris Tresilian,” adding, after a brief pause, during
which she had sobbed like a child: “It is done, Oscar.
I have bought your silence at the price of my daughter’s
reputation, even as I purchased wealth at the
cost of my husband’s honor.”</p>

<p>The last words were spoken very faintly, and Mrs.
Hilton now came farther into the room, with her
hands outstretched as if searching for something.</p>

<p>“My chair, Oscar; wheel it close to the fire,” she
whispered, and Hilton sprang forward quickly to place
a chair for her; but in his agitation his foot struck
against a small ormolu stand upon which Isabel had
placed a glass tank containing several gold fishes.</p>

<p>The stand was overturned, and the glass fell with a
loud crash, shattered to pieces on the floor.</p>

<p>The eyes of the somnambulist sprang wide open;<span class="pagenum">[306]</span>
she gazed wildly from one to another of the surrounding
faces, and with a cry that echoed from basement
to attic, fell to the ground, writhing in strong convulsions.</p>

<p>“Good God, I have killed her!” And Oscar Hilton
threw himself frantically on his knees beside her, while
the guests, attracted by that wild and pitiful cry, came
thronging to the spot, and Iris, sobbing out the words:
“Mamma! Oh, my poor mother!” attempted to reach
the spot where the latter lay, but fell back, feeble and
helpless as an infant, in Chester St. John’s outstretched
arms.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE ARREST.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In less than half an hour after Mrs. Hilton’s cry
had alarmed the ladies and gentlemen assembled to do
honor to Isabel Hilton in this celebration of her birthday,
the house was cleared of every guest with the exception
of Grace and Chester St. John.</p>

<p>“Go home, dear, and trust me to take care of Iris
as if she were indeed your sister,” Chester had said
to Grace; but pretty Grace had answered with a decision
and dignity quite new to her:</p>

<p>“No, Chester; you believed that Iris was guilty&mdash;you
were false to her when she most needed a true
friend; but I could never doubt her, and I shall stay
beside her now to give help and what comfort I may
in the trial I see before her.”</p>

<p>“God bless you for your faith in her, my sweet
sister!” answered Chester huskily, as he laid the trembling
form of Iris out of his arms, back into the chair
from which she had arisen, ere he hurried from the
house to bring the doctor to Mrs. Hilton.</p>

<p>While he was absent on this errand, Isabel, who
realized, with a sickening sense of desolation and
misery, that St. John was lost to her forever, escaped
to her own apartments, where she locked herself in,
refusing to admit even her maid until the afternoon
of the following day.</p>

<p>St. John returned with a doctor in less than fifteen
minutes. Mrs. Hilton was still in convulsions, and<span class="pagenum">[308]</span>
the physician saw at a glance that her case was hopeless.</p>

<p>He gave his decision promptly and without any
unnecessary beating around the bush.</p>

<p>“I will do all that is possible to relieve your wife’s
sufferings, Mr. Hilton, but it is beyond the power of
mortal skill to save her. She may linger with intervals
of consciousness for several days, and she may
pass away before daylight; but in any case I have
not the faintest hope of her recovery.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hilton groaned aloud at these words, while
Iris wept bitterly.</p>

<p>The latter had not entirely lost consciousness, but
that sickening feeling of weakness robbed her limbs
of their strength, and she could not for her life have
arisen from the chair in which Chester had placed her,
until nearly an hour had passed, and Chester and
Grace were preparing to take their departure.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hilton had been carried upstairs to her own
apartments, but Mr. Hilton still lingered, waiting in
an agony of impatience for the St. Johns to leave the
house.</p>

<p>Iris scarcely heard Grace’s words of farewell, but
every tone of Chester’s voice thrilled her heart to its
inmost core, as he bent over her chair and clasped both
her hands in his own.</p>

<p>“Iris, there has been treachery and deceit at work&mdash;and
through my belief in your guilt I have lost you.
Oh, this is killing me!”</p>

<p>He had crushed her passive hands so tightly in his
agony and regret that she with difficulty repressed a<span class="pagenum">[309]</span>
cry of pain, and then he hurriedly left the room, murmuring
as he threw himself back among the car
cushions by his sister’s side:</p>

<p>“Oh, if I had only trusted her, but my hand was
the first to fling a stone at her memory, my heart the
first to fail in its allegiance, and now I am pledged to
another, and she&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He could no longer carry out this bitter train of
thought, it almost maddened him to think of Iris as
he had left her, remaining on sufferance in the home
from which she was an outcast, and where her mother
lay dying.</p>

<p>After his departure Iris grew stronger, and, clasping
Oscar Hilton’s hand in passionate pleading, begged
to be allowed to nurse her mother until the end.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, please do not refuse me&mdash;I will intrude
not one hour after&mdash;after all is over,” she sobbed,
and, broken and weakened by the shock of this sudden
calamity, Mr. Hilton reluctantly consented for her to
stay, and a few moments later Iris took her position
beside her unconscious mother’s bed, prepared to do
her duty faithfully to the end, although she knew now
that this mother’s hand had doomed her to all the
sorrow she had been forced to endure.</p>

<p>Toward noon on the following day Evelyn Hilton
recovered consciousness, and, on recognizing her
daughter, appeared much pleased, and sank into a
heavy slumber, after whispering a few words which
were heard by Iris alone.</p>

<p>“I will tell you everything, my daughter, when I
wake, and you must try to forgive me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[310]</span></p>

<p>But, alas! before she again awakened, the greatest
trial of Iris’ life had come to her, and the mother’s
eyes were doomed to look no more on her child’s face
on this side of the grave.</p>

<p>As early as was at all consistent with the rules of
etiquette St. John and Grace called to inquire for
the sufferer.</p>

<p>Isabel received them, looking unusually handsome in
her bright, crimson morning robe, with all the rich
color faded out of her dark face, and her lips quivering
piteously as she reported that dear mamma was
not any better, and that she&mdash;Isabel&mdash;was forced to
stay out of the sick room because she could not listen
to poor mamma’s wild and improbable fancies.</p>

<p>Grace understood the yearning look in her brother’s
eyes, and proffered a timid request for a word with
Iris; but Isabel declared that Iris could not be induced
to leave her mother’s bedside for a moment, and the
visitors could not persist any further.</p>

<p>During their brief stay she found an opportunity
of speaking alone with Chester.</p>

<p>“This is a cruel trial, dear Chester; I long to hear
some words of sympathy from your lips; I have sore
need of your love now; it is all so lonesome and terrible
with papa always in the sick room, and the house
silent as the grave.”</p>

<p>She had clasped her small hands on his shoulder,
and bent her head upon them, so that her face was
very near his own; but although Chester smoothed
her dark, glossy hair with a gentle touch, he did not
give her the caress she expected, for between them<span class="pagenum">[311]</span>
there arose a vision he could not banish&mdash;the vision
of a sweet mignonne face, a pair of limpid, violet
eyes, and a pretty, bright-tressed head that he had
lately seen bowed in bitter sorrow.</p>

<p>The struggle going on within his heart was almost
maddening. Could he, with his chivalrous sense of
honor, ask this girl, who had openly confessed her
love for him, to release him from his promise, that
he might devote his life to the clearing of Iris Tresilian’s
name, and afterward to the task of winning
Iris’ forgiveness for having doubted her?</p>

<p>His conscience told him his first duty was to the
woman who was his promised wife, and for the first
time in his life he found it hard to obey this silent,
inward voice.</p>

<p>While he was taking his leave of Isabel a loud ring
at the doorbell startled them, and his heart throbbed
with an unaccountable feeling of foreboding.</p>

<p>Grace was already in the vestibule, and opened the
door before a servant had time to answer the summons.
Two men stood on the doorstep, one of whom
exclaimed, without preface:</p>

<p>“We are looking for a girl whose name, we believe,
is Aris, or Iris Tresilian, but who calls herself Maggie
Gordon.”</p>

<p>While speaking the man had coolly unbuttoned his
coat and exhibited a shining shield, at sight of which
Grace uttered a cry of terror, and clung to her
brother’s arm, trembling in every limb.</p>

<p>“Great heavens! There is some terrible mistake,”
ejaculated Chester, asking, as the men came across<span class="pagenum">[312]</span>
the threshold: “With what do you charge Iris Tresilian?”
to which the man replied in his usual cool,
matter-of-fact tone:</p>

<p>“With the theft of two hundred dollars. Madam
Marie Ward, of Forty-first Street, is her accuser.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[313]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_LIX">CHAPTER LIX.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“GOOD-BY.”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Miss Tresilian accused of theft! There is&mdash;there
must be some terrible mistake!” ejaculated Chester
St. John, while Grace clung to his arm, pale and shivering,
and Isabel, after the first shock of surprise was
over, actually rejoiced in the new disgrace that had
fallen on her rival, since it must serve to place Iris
beyond the pale of Chester’s forgiveness.</p>

<p>“I shall send upstairs for Iris, that these men may
see their mistake,” she said confidently, and Grace,
taking courage from her firm and determined manner,
now ventured to speak, begging Isabel to break the
news to Iris gently, lest the shock should be too much
for her. But the caution came just too late; for even
while Grace was speaking, Iris was descending the
stairs, her light footfall making no sound on the soft
velvet pile of the carpet, and the sound of Grace’s
low-toned voice coming distinctly to her ears.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she cried breathlessly, and one of
the men whose business it was to arrest her stepped
forward and answered:</p>

<p>“We have a painful duty to perform, young lady,
and the quicker it is over the better for all parties.
The name by which you have been known of late is
Maggie Gordon, is it not? You are certainly the
original of this portrait.”</p>

<p>The speaker here exhibited a penciled sketch of the
beautiful working girl, executed by the sister of<span class="pagenum">[314]</span>
Madam Ward, an amateur artist of no mean ability.
At sight of this drawing St. John could not repress
a groan, while Grace bowed her head and wept, and
Isabel turned a shade paler. Iris herself was outwardly
calm, but her eyes had the wild, scared look
of a hunted animal, and fixed themselves for one brief
second on the face of Chester St. John, as if mutely
appealing to him for aid.</p>

<p>The look went straight to his heart, and, leaving
his place by the side of Isabel, he spoke to Iris in a
tone that was tremulous with deep feeling:</p>

<p>“Depend on me, Iris; I shall do everything in my
power to clear you of this cruel charge. There must
be some bitter enemy plotting against your peace and
happiness, some bold and daring enemy, since they
dare accuse you of theft! Oh, child, if you would
only tell me everything I might save you this indignity&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush! Do not speak to me so; I&mdash;I cannot bear
it,” she cried passionately, for the struggle to keep
silent in the face of this appeal was almost killing her.
She dared not speak. She dared not utter one word
that might betray the author of her sufferings and
her shame, lest all the shameful story of the past
should be revealed and disgrace and dishonor fall on
her dying mother.</p>

<p>It was the opinion of the doctors that life might
linger in the poor, worn frame of Evelyn Hilton for
many days, although they had believed at the time
of her attack that her very minutes were numbered.
While her mother still lived, Iris’ lips were effectually
sealed, and, recovering at last from the emotion into<span class="pagenum">[315]</span>
which St. John’s words had thrown her, she turned
to him with the light of desperation in her wide,
dilated eyes, and a reckless defiance on her face that
filled him with horror and alarm.</p>

<p>“I have nothing to tell you, Mr. St. John. I cannot
explain the loss of madam’s two hundred dollars, and
I must expect to suffer the consequences. If these
men will allow me to get my hat and cloak, and will
wait just one moment while I bid my mother a last
farewell, I shall be ready to accompany them.”</p>

<p>She avoided meeting St. John’s eyes as she spoke
thus, and turned abruptly from him to the officers in
the doorway. “You will not refuse me one moment
with my mother, gentlemen, for, oh, sirs, she is dying;
we shall meet no more on earth.”</p>

<p>There was not a break or a quiver in the girl’s voice
now, but the look of dumb agony on her ashen face
would have melted a heart of oak, and the men readily
agreed to wait until she joined them, first ascertaining,
however, that there was no back exit by which she
might effect an escape. When she had disappeared
up the broad staircase, St. John turned to Isabel, inquiring
the whereabouts of her father, with the vague
idea that Mr. Hilton would in some manner be able
to save Iris&mdash;a hope that died again instantly as he
remembered Iris’ avowal, which had amounted almost
to a confession of guilt.</p>

<p>Isabel explained that her father had gone to Riverdale,
the residence of an eminent physician, said to
be skilled in the treatment of the disease of which
Mrs. Hilton was dying, and might not be at home before
evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[316]</span></p>

<p>“What is to be done? I would give half my fortune
to spare her this awful ordeal,” cried Chester, in despair.
“Oh, men,” turning desperately to the officers,
“can any amount of money tempt you to go away and
leave Iris Tresilian in peace? I will go at once to
this woman to whom the lost money belonged, and
repay it, aye, with interest, if she will withdraw her
charge, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It is no use, sir,” interrupted one of the officers;
“the charge has been made, and it is our duty to take
the young lady into custody. I am truly sorry, sir,
but I assure you there is no help for it.”</p>

<p>St. John realized the truth of this assertion, and
knew he could do nothing at present for the unfortunate
Iris.</p>

<p>“Come, Grace,” he said, gently addressing his
weeping sister in a voice that one would scarcely have
recognized as his own, “let me take you to the machine.
Go home at once, dear, and leave me to see what steps
may be taken in this dreadful affair. Your loyalty to
Iris has taught me a lesson, Gracie, and from this hour
she shall find in me as faithful a brother as you have
been a sister to her.”</p>

<p>Grace allowed him to lead her to the car, saying,
as he was closing the door upon her:</p>

<p>“She is innocent, brother; there is some enemy trying
to work her ruin. Be a friend to her in her
hour of need, for she seems to stand alone&mdash;even
Isabel&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush, darling; not a word of Isabel. I have asked
her to be my wife,” interrupted St. John, adding, in
a tone of ineffable tenderness: “God bless you for<span class="pagenum">[317]</span>
your faith in Iris, little sister, and God forgive me
for the wrong I have done her by my cruel doubts.”</p>

<p>As St. John’s car drove away a taxicab was passing
along, and the gentleman hailed it and placed it at
the disposal of the officers to convey Iris to prison.</p>

<p>In the meantime Iris had stolen softly into her
mother’s chamber, and fallen on her knees by her bedside.
Mrs. Hilton was still sleeping, and could not
hear the girl’s low sobbing, nor the broken, inarticulate
words that fell from her lips.</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, my mother, if you could speak one
kind, pitying word to me it would not be so hard to
suffer for your sake. If you could hear me when I
pray for you, if you could join me in asking God
to forgive your sin. Oh, dear Saviour! Thou hearest
me. Wilt Thou let my suffering atone for this dying
mother’s sin?”</p>

<p>As if the Divine Comforter had lifted some portion
of the burden from her well-nigh broken heart, Iris
arose from her knees and bent closely over the sleeper.</p>

<p>“This is our last earthly parting,” she whispered,
as she touched her lips softly to those of the unconscious
sufferer. “Your child will see your face on
earth no more. Good-by&mdash;good-by&mdash;my poor, poor
mother; I leave you in God’s keeping&mdash;good-by,
good-by.”</p>

<p>Iris now hurried from the room, lest the sound of
her choking sobs might arouse the sleeper, and a few
moments later she left the house, going forth with the
calmness of utter despair to meet her fate.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">CONCLUSION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>As the motor car containing Iris and the officers
rolled away from Oscar Hilton’s home, Peter, the
servant who had admitted Iris on the preceding evening,
stood in the area looking after the vehicle with
a perplexed and sorrowful expression on his good-natured
face.</p>

<p>A stranger came up excitedly, threw a hasty glance
at the departing machine, and with a nervous gesture
turned toward the servant.</p>

<p>“I say, my man,” said the stranger, addressing
Peter, “is this the residence of Mr. Hilton? I have
been sent to see the sick lady&mdash;his wife.”</p>

<p>Peter’s thoughts were traveling after Iris, and he
readily believed that the man was a new physician engaged
by Mr. Hilton.</p>

<p>“If you will step this way, sir, I will escort you to
Mrs. Hilton’s chamber.”</p>

<p>In less than five minutes the stranger was at the
bedside of the stricken woman.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hilton opened her eyes, and shivered slightly
as she met the man’s gaze. At first she did not recognize
him. Then with a low moan she gasped:</p>

<p>“You? What do you want?”</p>

<p>“I see you recognize me, my dear wife,” replied
the stranger, who was none other than Carleton Tresilian,
alias Charles Broughton. “You are sick unto
death, and I have come to torture you, to cause you<span class="pagenum">[319]</span>
some little bit of suffering in your dying moments to
repay you for the intense suffering that you have
caused me all these years. I am going to have my
revenge. Listen while I tell you of my plans for
vengeance.”</p>

<p>Before the wretched woman could reply, Tresilian
unfolded the story of his meeting with Iris, his pursuit
of her until she had been arrested charged with
the theft of two hundred dollars from Madam Ward.
From time to time during the recital of his cold-blooded
plan of revenge a spasm of pain crossed the
features of the unhappy woman.</p>

<p>“You have one chance to save your daughter, and
that is by signing a confession to the crime for which
I assumed the blame. If you refuse to do this, then
I will publish to the world not only your shame, but
your daughter’s shame as well. Will you sign?”</p>

<p>For a brief moment there was a terrific mental
struggle on the part of Mrs. Hilton. She was still
proud, and she was almost willing to sacrifice her
daughter in order to save, if possible, her own connection
with Carleton Tresilian. She realized that
she was on the brink of death, and the fear of punishment
hereafter was evidently strong upon her.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she finally faltered, “I will sign the confession,
but only to save my daughter’s honor.”</p>

<p>Tresilian quickly wrote out the confession and
summoned a couple of servants to witness the signing
of the document. His business completed, he quickly
left the house, but he had hardly passed from the
portals of the palatial home when Mrs. Hilton breathed
her last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[320]</span></p>

<p>He hurried to the home of Mrs. Neville, where,
after a stormy scene, the woman promised to return
the money to Madam Ward and thus clear Iris of the
terrible charge hanging over her. When a messenger
had been called and dispatched with the money, Tresilian,
before Mrs. Neville could interfere, jerked a
revolver from his pocket and committed suicide.</p>

<p>When the effects of the dead man were examined,
Mrs. Hilton’s confession was found in his pocket.</p>

<p>With the astounding discovery that the girl whom
he loved most in all the world was guiltless of any
wrongdoing, Chester St. John pleaded with Isabel for
the release from his irksome engagement. She, with
a woman’s quick intuition, realized that she could
never hold his affections, and reluctantly gave him up.</p>

<p>Eventually Iris married the man whom she loved,
and shortly after the wedding Mr. and Mrs. Frank
Laurier gave a large reception in honor of the newlyweds.
All during the succeeding years the affection
between Iris and Jessie grew, and they became the
dearest and most affectionate friends, both realizing
the terrible experiences through which each had passed.</p>

<p class="center p1">THE END.</p>

<p class="p1">“She Could Not Tell” will be the title of the next
volume, No 944, of the <span class="smcap">New Eagle Series</span>. The
forthcoming story is from the pen of Ida Reade Allen,
and it is a most delightful tale of love, romance, hate,
and intrigue. It is the kind of novel that you will not
put down until you have finished it.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
